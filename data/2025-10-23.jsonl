Our approach shows that broadening\nthe support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented\nby offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery\nand generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations\nsignificantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies\nare successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that\nthese methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or\nsuboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This\nunderscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data\nfor robust policy learning in robotics."}

In this study, we\npresent an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to\nregulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a\ntendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a\ncrucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic\nhands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise\nmovement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This\nadvanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and\nadjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the\nintentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using\nEuler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and\nexperimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing\nwrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique\nsignificantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more\nnatural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and\nbiomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent\nprosthetic systems."}

Current methods face a critical\ntrade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit\nscene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large\nmodels during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot\nframework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a\ncoarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision\nAction for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This\nmodular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different\nscales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a\nsystem that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.\nLaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the\nVLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen\nenvironments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world\ndeployment."}

As the detection forms a key component of real-time\nlocalisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an\noptimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally\nequivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,\nthe mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by\ntwo to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the\nlocalisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant\noverall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to\ndetection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on\nvarious 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,\nas well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.\nThus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming."}

In robotics,\nVision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving\ncomplex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically\nreadjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we\nintroduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA\nlow-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by\nincluding them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and\ncapabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning\nphase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an\nassessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful\nconclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar\napproaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on\nunstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires\nstructured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate\nLITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that\nuse high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks."}

We\npropose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts\nthe missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference\nbetween the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to\nguide exploration.
