In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.\n  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations. Our results suggest that hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is a promising direction for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u516d\u8f74\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u516d\u8f74\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81c2\u5728\u710a\u63a5\u548c\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u7b49\u8bb8\u591a\u5236\u9020\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u8f74\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb8\u591a\u64cd\u4f5c\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u963b\u5c3c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u54c8\u96f7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51b7\u55b7\u6d82\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u89e3\u51b3\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1aABB\u64cd\u63a7\u5668\u548c\u51b7\u55b7\u67aa\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u78c1SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u666e\u904d\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\uff08\u78c1\u573a\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u60ef\u6027\u78c1SLAM\uff08IM-SLAM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u677e\u8026\u5408\u548c\u7d27\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8026\u5408\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u78c1SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u73b0\u6709SLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u677e\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u57283D IM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u8026\u5408IM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances.

Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2).

Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height.

To address the limited query-rejection capability of current voice assistants, this paper presents the first Chinese-oriented open-source benchmark and evaluation suite for smart homes, together with a personalized query-rejection method based on large language models. On the data side, we construct the first multimodal query-rejection dataset tailored for domestic scenarios, containing 11,913 manually labeled text-speech pairs that systematically cover twelve typical dialogue types (e.g., chit-chat, non-human sounds, valid commands, ambiguous references, device-irrelevant requests). Fine-grained labels, conversational context and multi-turn information are provided to support both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations across language and multimodal large models. On the method side, we propose a three-tier collaborative architecture: first, a Qwen-2.5-3B adapter fine-tuned to model family-agnostic semantic boundaries; second, a dynamic household-level historical dialogue module to capture personalized habits; third, a household-specific RAG knowledge base that explicitly memorizes and revises past false-rejection cases. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and fine-tuned general LLMs on the constructed dataset, with pronounced gains in rejection accuracy for family-specific expressions and complex multi-turn scenarios.

However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load.

While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller.

We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces.

Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average.

This paper presents a unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework for seamless pedestrian localization and provides a controlled comparison of three probabilistic back-ends: an error-state extended Kalman filter, sliding-window factor graph optimization, and a particle filter. The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove.

In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation\". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM\", is proposed.

The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms.

To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications.

Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\\%-80\\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b89\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u98de\u884c\u5458\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u57f9\u8bad\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u7a00\u758fRRT\uff08SST\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u8c03\u6574\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u843d\u4f1e\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8f6c\u5f2f\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8620\\%-80\\%\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7740\u9646\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6307\u5357\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u805a\u5149\u98de\u884c\u5458\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.

Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u8d85\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08Veo\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u653f\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316Robot\u884c\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6cdb\u5316\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5408\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Ethical Emergency Braking with Deep Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance driving safety, for example by enabling safe vehicle following and more efficient traffic scheduling. For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable. However, conservative worst-case-based control strategies come at the price of reduced flexibility and may compromise overall performance. In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration.

We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u6b8b\u4f59\u529b\u7684\u5168\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u914d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u8026\u5408\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u53bb\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u6b8b\u4f59\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b8b\u4f59\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8865\u507f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u7528\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u96f6-shot\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u7eb3\u5165\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f6-shot\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u548c\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u7ec4\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002"}}

We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.\n  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u514b\u670d\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LiDAR\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u5bfc\u822a\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ba1\u9053", "result": "PPO\u7b56\u7565\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5065\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u9650\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u5730\u4e0b\u6216\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.
