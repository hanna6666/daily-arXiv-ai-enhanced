The AIS-stratified architecture is treated as a diegetic prototype placed in a plausible near-future setting and examined through the method of design fiction.

Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space.

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction.

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance.

Existing methods face a trad-off: online planners and controllers lack formal safety guarantees, while offline planners lack adaptability to changes in the number of agents or desired formation. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid architecture where a single leader tracks a pre-computed, safe trajectory, which serves as a shared trajectory backup set for all follower agents. Followers execute a nominal formation-keeping tracking controller, and are guaranteed to remain safe by always possessing a known-safe backup maneuver along the leader's path. We formally prove this method ensures collision avoidance with both static obstacles and other agents. The primary contributions are: (1) the multi-agent gatekeeper algorithm, which extends our single-agent gatekeeper framework to multi-agent systems; (2) the trajectory backup set for provably safe inter-agent coordination for leader-follower formation control; and (3) the first application of the gatekeeper framework in a 3D environment.

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns.

However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources.

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability.

Six-axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation.

Based on this hybrid state, we derive a hierarchical uncertainty volume that quantifies both implicit global structure quality and explicit local surface confidence. To focus optimization on the most informative regions, we propose an uncertainty-driven keyframe selection strategy that anchors high-entropy viewpoints as sparse attention nodes, coupled with a viewpoint-space sliding window for uncertainty-aware local refinement.

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details.

However, achieving robust and precise motion with strong force interaction remains a significant challenge. Based on the above limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning control framework that simultaneously optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy through coupled training under external force interaction environments. Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback. Moreover, HAFO employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic framework in which the Critic-network access to privileged spring-damping forces guides the actor-network to learn a generalizable, robust policy for resisting external disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves stable control of humanoid robot under various strong force interactions, showing remarkable performance in load tasks and ensuring stable robot operation under rope tension disturbances.

By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments.

By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera. Our in-depth evaluation with a real robot and Gazebo environments demonstrates a >96% accuracy in predicting power consumption and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3apNav\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba(AMRs)\u7684\u7269\u7406/\u673a\u68b0\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790AMRs\u7684\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0CPS\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u529f\u8017\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548cC\u3001P\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "method": "pNav\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347AMRs\u7684\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u529f\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caAMR\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u540c\u3002", "result": "pNav\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548cGazebo\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230>96%\u7684\u529f\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c38.1%\u7684\u529f\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eROS\u5bfc\u822a\u6808\u30012D LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5236\u4f5c\uff0cpNav\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86>96%\u7684\u529f\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca38.1%\u7684\u529f\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5f71\u54cd\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper tackles this problem and allows to extend existing rigid-body pose estimation methods to non-rigid systems. Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties. We demonstrate this feasibility on a simple spring-camera system, and show how it robustly resolves the typically ill-posed problem of metric scale and gravity recovery in monocular visual odometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u521a\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u975e\u521a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u52a9\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u5f62-\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4B\u6837\u6761\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u5149\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u67d4\u6027\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u521a\u4f53\u5047\u8bbe\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5f39\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4B\u6837\u6761\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u5e94\u7528\u725b\u987f\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5efa\u7acb\u89c6\u89c9\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u8bf1\u5bfc\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u521a\u6027\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5408\u9002\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u6fc0\u53d1\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f39\u7c27-\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u529b\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Experimental results on various 2D and 3D datasets -- including LASA handwriting and demonstrations recorded kinesthetically from the Franka Emika Panda robot -- validate S$^2$-NNDS effectiveness in learning robust, safe, and stable motions from potentially unsafe demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6S$^2$-NNDS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73af\u5883\u65f6\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60Lyapunov\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6S$^2$-NNDS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cLyapunov\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "S$^2$-NNDS\u80fd\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002"}}

However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ProphRL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c(VLA)\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u540e\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c(VLA)\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u4eff\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5Prophet\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Flow-action-GRPO\u548cFlowScale\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684VLA\u540e\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aProphRL\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7fVLA\u5728\u540e\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7ProphRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c(VLA)\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
