This work presents a personality-aware multimodal\nframework that integrates eye-tracking sequences, Big Five personality traits,\nand contextual stimulus cues to predict both perceived and felt emotions.\nSeventy-three participants viewed speech-containing clips from the CREMA-D\ndataset while providing eye-tracking signals, personality assessments, and\nemotion ratings. Our neural models captured temporal gaze dynamics and fused\nthem with trait and stimulus information, yielding consistent gains over SVM\nand literature baselines.

Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it\nimproves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline."}

To address these\ngaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced\nperception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher\nconstrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module\noperating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);\nthen, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by\ntexture degradation or partial occlusion.

While transferring into\nhand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires\nnot only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along\nthe object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation\nframework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated\nobjects.

However, by reducing\ncomplex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining\nthe shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation\nplanner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative\nrobot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear\nand non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.\nWe theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do\nnot need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%.

In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a\ntwo-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by\nlearning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then\ntransferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key\ninsight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building\nnew end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool\ngeometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can\nthen be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and\nusing the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by\n30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation\ntool-usage tasks."}

Suturing skill varies widely between surgeons, highlighting the need\nfor robot assistance. Previous robot suturing works, such as STITCH 1.0 [1],\nstruggle to fully close wounds due to inaccurate needle tracking and poor\nthread management. To address these challenges, we present STITCH 2.0, an\nelevated augmented dexterity pipeline with seven improvements including:\nimproved EKF needle pose estimation, new thread untangling methods, and an\nautomated 3D suture alignment algorithm. Experimental results over 15 trials\nfind that STITCH 2.0 on average achieves 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures\nper trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the\nprevious baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0\naverages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website:\nhttps://stitch-2.github.io/"}
