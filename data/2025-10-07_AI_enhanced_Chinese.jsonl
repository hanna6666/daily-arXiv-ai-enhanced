We present an immersive mixed\nreality (MR) simulator designed to prepare adult patients for their first CT\nscan, aiming to improve both emotional and physical preparedness. In this\npaper, we review existing methods for reducing scan-related anxiety -- from\neducational materials to virtual reality exposure -- and identify their\nlimitations. We then detail the design and technical implementation of our MR\nsimulator, which combines a virtual CT suite walkthrough, guided relaxation\ntraining, realistic scan simulation (including audiovisual cues and breath-hold\npractice), and interactive feedback. The inclusion of these features is\ngrounded in evidence-based rationale drawn from prior studies in patient\nanxiety reduction and compliance. We report results from a pilot study ($n=50$)\ndemonstrating that patients who used the simulator had significantly lower\npre-scan anxiety levels and improved compliance during the actual CT procedure,\ncompared to controls.

This paper presents a novel MR guidance system using the Magic Leap\nhead-mounted display to assist surgeons in executing precise scalpel movements\nduring liver surgery.

We describe the system design, including preoperative\nmodeling, registration of virtual content to the phantom, and real-time\nvisualization through the Magic Leap device. In a controlled phantom study,\nsurgical trainees performed resection tasks with and without MR guidance.\nQuantitative results demonstrated that MR guidance improved cutting accuracy\n(mean deviation from planned path was reduced from 5.0 mm without AR to 2.0 mm\nwith AR guidance) and efficiency (mean task time decreased from 55 s to 32 s).\nThese improvements of approximately 60% in accuracy and 40% in speed underscore\nthe potential benefit of MR in surgical navigation. Participants reported that\nthe Magic Leap visualization enhanced depth perception and confidence in\nlocating tumor boundaries. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of an\nMR-assisted surgical guidance approach, highlighting its feasibility on a\nrealistic organ phantom. We discuss the technical challenges (registration\naccuracy, line-of-sight, user ergonomics) and outline future steps toward\nclinical translation.

We are bringing together\nthree major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel\narchitecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn\nfrom heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general.\nSecond, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal\nreasoning process in natural language.

Current\nsampling-based motion planners face challenges in scaling to high-dimensional\nconfiguration spaces and often require post-processing to interpolate and\nsmooth the generated paths, resulting in time inefficiency in complex\nenvironments.

HH\nsubjects were less likely to detect and more likely to collide with pedestrians\nthan NV, particularly for blind-side targets.

HH subjects also\nbiased their head rotations toward the blind side and more after detection\ncompared to before. Collision avoidance difficulties as reported by HH\nsubjects, which clinical measures fail to capture, were recorded and analyzed\nwith objective measures.

The destination-to-chutes task mapping is used to determine which\nchutes a robot can drop its package. Finding a high-quality task mapping is\nchallenging because of the complexity of a real-world RSS. First, optimizing\ntask mapping is interdependent with robot target assignment and path planning.\nSecond, chutes will be CLOSED for a period of time once they receive sufficient\npackages to allow for downstream processing. Third, task mapping quality\ndirectly impacts the downstream processing, as scattered chutes for the same\ndestination increase package handling time. In this paper, we first formally\ndefine task mappings and the problem of Task Mapping Optimization (TMO). We\nthen present a simulator of RSS to evaluate task mappings.

However, recent soft robots designed for locomotion and\nmanipulation often exhibit a large width-to-length ratio that categorizes them\nas 2D shells. For analysis and shape-morphing control purposes, we develop an\nefficient coordinate-free static model of hard-magnetic shells found in soft\nmagnetic grippers and walking soft robots. The approach is based on a novel\nformulation of Cosserat shell theory on the Special Euclidean group\n($\\mathbf{SE}(3)$). The shell is assumed to be a 2D manifold of material points\nwith six degrees of freedom (position & rotation) suitable for capturing the\nbehavior of a uniformly distributed array of spheroidal hard magnetic particles\nembedded in the rheological elastomer. The shell's configuration manifold is\nthe space of all smooth embeddings $\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow\\mathbf{SE}(3)$.\nAccording to a novel definition of local deformation gradient based on the Lie\ngroup structure of $\\mathbf{SE}(3)$, we derive the strong and weak forms of\nequilibrium equations, following the principle of virtual work.

Through both simulation and physical experiments, we\ndemonstrate their impact on morphology prediction, trajectory planning, and\ndamage recovery in state-of-the-art pipelines. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce a task-aware denoising framework that couples classical restoration\nwith morphology-preserving constraints, ensuring retention of structural cues\ncritical for self-modeling.

This issue stems from their overreliance\non continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create\nisolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA)\nframework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories,\nthereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory\nfine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning\nstrategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages\ntemporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot\nend effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these\nsparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that\ndelivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot.\nIn multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and\ngeneralization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints:\nit uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires\nno wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy\nclosely approximates that of single-task expert models.

To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to\nenforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles\nmodels of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely\nused. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes\nperformance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining\naccurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven\nalternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on\nhand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal\npolicies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control\n(DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe\npolicies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM)\nagents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into\nstructured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances,\ndata-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow\nresponse times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them\nless practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard\ncomputing, or strict memory constraints.

Unlike soil digging, it\ninvolves manipulating large, irregular rocks in unstructured environments where\ncomplex contact interactions with granular material make model-based control\nimpractical. Existing autonomous excavation methods focus mainly on continuous\nmedia or rely on specialized grippers, limiting their applicability to\nreal-world construction sites. This paper introduces a fully data-driven\ncontrol framework for rock capturing that eliminates the need for explicit\nmodeling of rock or soil properties. A model-free reinforcement learning agent\nis trained in the AGX Dynamics simulator using the Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO) algorithm and a guiding reward formulation. The learned policy outputs\njoint velocity commands directly to the boom, arm, and bucket of a CAT365\nexcavator model. Robustness is enhanced through extensive domain randomization\nof rock geometry, density, and mass, as well as the initial configurations of\nthe bucket, rock, and goal position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study to develop and evaluate an RL-based controller for the rock\ncapturing task. Experimental results show that the policy generalizes well to\nunseen rocks and varying soil conditions, achieving high success rates\ncomparable to those of human participants while maintaining machine stability.\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of learning-based excavation\nstrategies for discrete object manipulation without requiring specialized\nhardware or detailed material models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5ca9\u77f3\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u4ecb\u8d28\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u5939\u5177\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7AGX Dynamics\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5ca9\u77f3\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u94f2\u6597\u3001\u5ca9\u77f3\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff0c\u6240\u5b66\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5ca9\u77f3\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u6b8a\u786c\u4ef6\u6216\u8be6\u7ec6\u6750\u6599\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5ca9\u77f3\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002"}}

To simplify this\nplanning, we introduce a decentralised gradient-based framework that uses a\npiecewise continuous energy function through the automatic composition of\nadaptive potential functions. This approach generates sub-goals using only\nmyopic optimisation, rather than long-horizon planning. It demonstrates\neffectiveness at solving long-horizon tasks due to the structure and adaptivity\nof the energy function. We show that our approach scales to physical bimanual\nassembly tasks for constructing tight-tolerance assemblies. In these\nexperiments, we discover that our gradient-based rapid replanning framework\ngenerates automatic retries, coordinated motions and autonomous handovers in an\nemergent fashion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u53cc\u624b\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684TAMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u56f0\u96be\u65f6\u53cd\u5e94\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6bb5\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6f5c\u529b\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u975e\u957f\u8fdc\u89c4\u5212\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u53cc\u624b\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff08TAMP\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6f5c\u529b\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7269\u7406\u53cc\u624b\u7ec4\u88c5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u8bd5\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u63a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7d27\u516c\u5dee\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6267\u884c\u529b\u3002"}}

Successfully training an HN-based VLA is\nnontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that\nimprove its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from\nexisting vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation\nstrategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even\nhigher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation,\nwhile significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a\nstate-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters\nat test time by $90\\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\\times$.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/MasterXiong/HyperVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "HyperVLA\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8690\u500d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u4e86120\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperVLA\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,\nderive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on\nhardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip\nlimits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an\neight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg\nprovides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke\ndouble rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far\nricher gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we\nused deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored\nspace. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under\nthe right priors and discover novel behaviors as well.

ACQL supports most LTL task specifications and\nleverages their automaton representation to explicitly encode stage-wise goal\nprogression and both stationary and non-stationary safety constraints. We show\nthat ACQL outperforms existing methods across a range of continuous control\ntasks, including cases where prior methods fail to satisfy either goal-reaching\nor safety constraints. We further validate its real-world applicability by\ndeploying ACQL on a 6-DOF robotic arm performing a goal-reaching task in a\ncluttered, cabinet-like space with safety constraints. Our results demonstrate\nthat ACQL is a robust and scalable solution for learning robotic behaviors\naccording to rich temporal specifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACQL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9LTL\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "ACQL\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81c2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "ACQL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u8303\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

While recent advances in general motion\ntracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these\npolicies lack the precision and object awareness required for\nloco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual\nlearning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human\nmotion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion,\nserves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements.\nAn efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT\noutputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further\nfacilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object\ntracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that\nencourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a\ncurriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We\nevaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results\nshow substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness\nover strong baselines.
