Despite extensive recent advances in\nidentifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between\ntheory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap\nby bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,\nthis paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of\nposition and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose\nEstimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES\nembodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative\nfactors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic\nlatent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,\nand camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the\ncontrollable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated\n(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that\nvariables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In\nrobotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various\njoints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in\nsemi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully\ndisentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the\nground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional\nchanges, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison\nwith a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This\npaper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical\ntestbed for CRL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7ROPES\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "ROPES\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6ROPES\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c6\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

In our experiments, we show that PPC\nimproves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,\nproviding a principled alternative to domain randomization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdPCA\u70b9\u4e91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u7edf\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u4ecd\u663e\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdPCA\u70b9\u4e91\uff08PPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPPC\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PCA Point Cloud (PPC)\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u5408\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Predictive approaches require a\nstrong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches\nrequire no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find\nhigh-quality paths to navigate effectively.\n  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce\nplanning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense\nplanning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It\ncan also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.\n  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning\nrequires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning\nproblem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent\nproblems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning\nalgorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge\ntowards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans\nin the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.\nThis is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees\n(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning\nalgorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect\n(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u7684ASAO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u7403\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u5fc5\u66f4\u65b0\u5df2\u6709\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81c2\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Effort Informed Trees (EIT*)\u548cAsymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC)\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "EIT*\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u66f4\u77ed\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u80af\u5b9a\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18(ASAO)\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u589e\u91cf\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u5212\u3002"}}

One core idea of\nGSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level\nvision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL\ndecomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill\nprimitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning\nin the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the\nhigh-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical\nactions are mapped back to the world frame for execution.

This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic\nhuman activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach\ncan generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language\ndescriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.\nWe process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training\ndataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide\nrange of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment\nvariations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.\nWe design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on\nthis dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely\nunseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount\nof real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and\ngeneralization to novel objects in real robotic experiments.
