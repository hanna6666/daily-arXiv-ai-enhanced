In this work, we address these challenges by introducing DREAMer-VXS, a model-based framework for Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) exploration that learns to plan from imagined latent trajectories. Our approach centers on learning a comprehensive world model from partial and high-dimensional LiDAR observations. This world model is composed of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which learns a compact representation of the environment's structure, and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM), which models complex temporal dynamics. By leveraging this learned model as a high-speed simulator, the agent can train its navigation policy almost entirely in imagination. This methodology decouples policy learning from real-world interaction, culminating in a 90% reduction in required environmental interactions to achieve expert-level performance when compared to state-of-the-art model-free SAC baselines. The agent's behavior is guided by an actor-critic policy optimized with a composite reward function that balances task objectives with an intrinsic curiosity bonus, promoting systematic exploration of unknown spaces. We demonstrate through extensive simulated experiments that DREAMer-VXS not only learns orders of magnitude faster but also develops more generalizable and robust policies, achieving a 45% increase in exploration efficiency in unseen environments and superior resilience to dynamic obstacles.", "AI": {"tldr": "DREAMer-VXS\u4e3aAGV\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u6837\u672c\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DREAMer-VXS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4LiDAR\u89c2\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7efc\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684actor-critic\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u578bSAC\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c90%\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DREAMer-VXS\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8645%\u3002"}}

In this work, we present XFlowMP, a task-conditioned generative motion planner that models robot trajectory evolution as entropic flows bridging stochastic noises and expert demonstrations via Schrodinger bridges given the inquiry task configuration. Specifically, our method leverages Schrodinger bridges as a conditional flow matching coupled with a score function to learn motion fields with high-order dynamics while encoding start-goal configurations, enabling the generation of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Through evaluations, XFlowMP achieves up to 53.79% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 36.36% smoother motions, and 39.88% lower energy consumption while comparing to the next-best baseline on the RobotPointMass benchmark, and also reducing short-horizon planning time by 11.72%. On long-horizon motions in the LASA Handwriting dataset, our method maintains the trajectories with 1.26% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 3.96% smoother, and 31.97% lower energy.

Traditionally this human-driven process requires navigating coder fatigue and interpretative drift, thus posing challenges when scaling analysis to larger, more complex datasets. Computational approaches to augment qualitative research have been met with skepticism, partly due to their inability to replicate the nuance, context-awareness, and sophistication of human analysis. Large language models, however, present new opportunities to automate aspects of qualitative analysis while upholding rigor and research quality in important ways. To assess their benefits and limitations - and build trust among qualitative researchers - these approaches must be rigorously benchmarked against human-generated datasets.

To scale data collection, many researchers have turned to leveraging human manipulation videos available online.

In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines large foundation models for video understanding with point tracking techniques to extract dense trajectories of all task-relevant keypoints during manipulation.

Since the emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI), computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As Gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualisation. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilise Gen AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Analogical LLM Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of tradi tional ideation sessions.

Recently, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) has shown promising results in some challenging autonomous navigation tasks without prior environmental information. However, these methods overlook situations where noise patterns vary across different environmental conditions, hindering safe navigation and disrupting the learning of value functions. To address the problem, we propose DRIQN to integrate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with implicit quantile networks to optimize worst-case performance under natural environmental conditions. Leveraging explicit subgroup modeling in the replay buffer, DRIQN incorporates heterogeneous noise sources and target robustness-critical scenarios. Experimental results based on the risk-sensitive environment demonstrate that DRIQN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving +13.51\\% success rate, -12.28\\% collision rate and +35.46\\% for time saving, +27.99\\% for energy saving, compared with the runner-up.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRIQN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u4f4d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u6c34\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff08DRO\uff09\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u4f4d\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "DRIQN\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86+13.51%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c-12.28%\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8282\u770135.46%\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c27.99%\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4e9a\u519b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "DRIQN\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u3002"}}

A fundamental problem within the capitalist economy, put simply, lies in the enslavement of labor and the colonization of resources. To address these issues, movements promoting digital democracy and cooperative platforms have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional capitalist systems. From the perspective of integrating information systems with real-world social, environmental, and economic systems, Cyber-Physical Systems have been proposed for applications in Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. One such CPS is the Social Co-OS (cyber-human social co-operating system). Social Co-OS is a co-operating system between cyber and human societies that conceptualizes the social system as a dynamic, circular structure composed of three layers: individual behavior, interindividual interaction, and institutional formation. Within this framework, the cyber system supports collective decision-making and individual cooperative behavior across these layers. The objective of this study is to define a novel application architecture based on the Social Co-OS concept, design a user interface flow, and implement it in practice. Specifically, we develop a social impact evaluator, a pluralistic policy simulator, and a consensus-building facilitator, which constitute the deliberative and political loop of Social Co-OS. Additionally, we implement a personality estimator and a behavior change promoter, which constitute the operational and administrative loop, along with a common mediator that serves as the cyber-human interface. Through these implementations, we demonstrate that Social Co-OS applications can effectively support human social systems and offer practical utility for policy co-making and co-operation, as evidenced by examples grounded in real-world challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Social Co-OS \u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5143\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u5171\u5efa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u5b57\u6c11\u4e3b\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u793e\u4ea4\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u3001\u591a\u5143\u653f\u7b56\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8005\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 Social Co-OS \u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "Social Co-OS \u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5171\u540c\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

To reduce their opacity Concept Models (CMs), such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), were introduced to predict human-defined concepts as an intermediate step before predicting task labels. This enhances the interpretability of DNNs. In a human-machine setting greater interpretability enables humans to improve their understanding and build trust in a DNN. In the introduction of CBMs, the models demonstrated increased task accuracy as incorrect concept predictions were replaced with their ground truth values, known as intervening on the concept predictions. In a collaborative setting, if the model task accuracy improves from interventions, trust in a model and the human-machine task accuracy may increase. However, the result showing an increase in model task accuracy was produced without human evaluation and thus it remains unknown if the findings can be applied in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we ran the first human studies using CBMs to evaluate their human interaction in collaborative task settings. Our findings show that CBMs improve interpretability compared to standard DNNs, leading to increased human-machine alignment. However, this increased alignment did not translate to a significant increase in task accuracy. Understanding the model's decision-making process required multiple interactions, and misalignment between the model's and human decision-making processes could undermine interpretability and model effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "CBMs\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\uff08CMs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CBMs\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1CBMs\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u672a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CBMs\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6DNNs\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ICD-Net\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5904\u7406\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u9650\u5236\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0cICD-Net\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4d\u79fb\u56fe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u6620\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684VINS-Fusion\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cICD-Net\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ICD-Net\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc738%\u7684\u5747\u503cAPE\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning. Unlike prior approaches, VISTAv2 does not replace the planner. The online value map is fused at score level with the base objective, providing reachability and risk-aware guidance. Concretely, we employ an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor to synthesize short-horizon futures, align them with the natural language instruction via a vision-language scorer, and fuse multiple rollouts in a differentiable imagination-to-value head to output an imagined egocentric value map. For efficiency, rollouts occur in VAE latent space with a distilled sampler and sparse decoding, enabling inference on a single consumer GPU. Evaluated on MP3D and RoboTHOR, VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines, and ablations show that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical, suggesting that VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN.", "AI": {"tldr": "VISTAv2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u578b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6eda\u52a8\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5728\u7ebf\u4ef7\u503c\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u663e\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u503c\u4ea7\u751f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u52a8\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u77ed\u671f\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5728\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\u5230\u4ef7\u503c\u5934\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6eda\u52a8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ef7\u503c\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728MP3D\u548cRoboTHOR\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cVISTAv2\u5728\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e4b\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4e14\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u884c\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u60f3\u8c61\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4ef7\u503c\u56fe\u89c4\u5212\u90fd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "VISTAv2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\uff08VLN\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Our Random Forest generalized models achieved mean absolute errors of 3.29 at midterm and 3.98 (out of 32) at the end of semester on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (short form), identifying smartphone screen usage and location mobility to be key predictors. The one-shot approach leveraging large language models reduced prediction errors by up to 42% compared to zero-shot inference.

In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning.

The advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has accelerated the development of navigation policies that enable robots to incorporate these social conventions while effectively reaching their objectives. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of DRL-based approaches to socially aware navigation, highlighting key aspects such as proxemics, human comfort, naturalness, trajectory and intention prediction, which enhance robot interaction in human environments. This work critically analyzes the integration of value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms alongside neural network architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, and transformer networks, for enhancing agent learning and representation in socially aware navigation. Furthermore, we examine crucial evaluation mechanisms, including metrics, benchmark datasets, simulation environments, and the persistent challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Our comparative analysis of the literature reveals that while DRL significantly improves safety, and human acceptance over traditional approaches, the field still faces setback due to non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, absence of standardized social metrics, computational burdens that limit scalability, and difficulty in transferring simulation to real robotic hardware applications.

However, integrated frameworks are lacking that can account for heterogeneous agents and draw on different scientific fields, such as human-factors engineering and artificial intelligence. Therefore, joint hybrid intelligence is described as a framework abstracting humans and artificial intelligence as decision making agents. A general definition of intelligence is provided on the basis of decision making competence being applicable to agents of different sorts. This framework is used for proposing the interrelated design space of joint hybrid intelligence being aimed at integrating the heterogeneous capabilities of humans and artificial intelligence.

To address this limitation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, enabling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards.

This paper presents a novel methodology for identifying viable occupational transitions for truck drivers as transport automation advances. Unlike traditional workforce transition analyses that focus primarily on skill similarity, wages, and employment demand, this methodology incorporates four integrated components: task-level automation analysis, skill similarity assessment, labour market conditions analysis, and empirical validation using historical transition patterns. Applying this methodology to Australian truck drivers shows that while ATs will automate core driving tasks, many non-driving responsibilities will continue requiring a human, suggesting occupational evolution rather than wholesale displacement. A skill similarity analysis identifies 17 occupations with high transferability, while labour market analysis reveals significant trade-offs between wage levels and job availability across potential transition pathways. Key findings indicate that bus and coach driving, along with earthmoving plant operation, emerge as high-priority transition options, offering comparable wages and positive employment growth. Delivery and forklift driving present medium-priority pathways with abundant opportunities but lower wages. A regression analysis of historical transitions confirms that skill similarity, wage differentials, geographic accessibility, and qualification requirements all significantly influence actual transition patterns, with some viable pathways currently underutilised. The research provides policymakers, industry stakeholders, and educational institutions with evidence-based guidance for supporting workforce adaptation to technological change.

Most existing systems only allow all agents to move synchronously, limiting their use in applications that require differentiated actuation. This research aims to design a controller capable of regulating the radial distance between micro-agents using only the angle \u03c8of a global magnetic field as the actuation parameter, demonstrating potential for practical applications. The proposed cascade control approach enables faster and more precise adjustment of the inter-agent distance than a proportional controller, while maintaining smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt changes in the orientation of the magnetic field, making it suitable for real-world implementation. A bibliographic review was conducted to develop the physical model, considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and velocities in viscous media. A PID controller was implemented to regulate the radial distance, followed by a PD controller in cascade to smooth changes in field orientation. These controllers were simulated in MATLAB, showing that the PID controller reduced convergence time to the desired radius by about 40%. When adding the second controller, the combined PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes, with fluctuations of only \\pm 5^\\circ. These results validate the feasibility of controlling the radial distance of two microrobots using a shared magnetic field in a fast and precise manner, without abrupt variations in the control angle.

While multi-robot systems offer promising solutions to address labor shortages and rising costs, the efficient scheduling of these systems presents complex optimization challenges. This research investigates the multi-trip picking robot task scheduling (MTPRTS) problem. The problem is characterized by its provision for robot redeployment while maintaining strict adherence to makespan constraints, and encompasses the interdependencies among robot weight, robot load, and energy consumption, thus introducing substantial computational challenges that demand sophisticated optimization algorithms.To effectively tackle this complexity, metaheuristic approaches, which often utilize local search mechanisms, are widely employed. Despite the critical role of local search in vehicle routing problems, most existing algorithms are hampered by redundant local operations, leading to slower search processes and higher risks of local optima, particularly in large-scale scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) that introduces three key innovations: (1) integrated load-distance balancing initialization method, (2) a clustering-based local search mechanism, and (3) an experience-based adaptive selection strategy. To ensure solution feasibility under makespan constraints, we develop a solution repair strategy implemented through three distinct frameworks.

We propose SpeedAug, an RL-based policy acceleration framework that efficiently adapts pre-trained policies for faster task execution. SpeedAug constructs behavior prior that encompasses diverse tempos of task execution by pre-training a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations. Empirical results on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that RL fine-tuning initialized from this tempo-enriched policy significantly improves the sample efficiency of existing RL and policy acceleration methods while maintaining high success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6SpeedAug\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d outperform \u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u653f\u7b56\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u80fd\u529b\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u6536\u96c6\u66f4\u5feb\u793a\u8303\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 SpeedAug\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u793a\u8303\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SpeedAug \u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

We propose a novel approach that enables users to query the knowledge graph by specifying prototype graphs in natural language and visually editing them. This approach enables non-experts to formulate queries without prior knowledge of the ontology and specific query languages. Our approach converts natural language to these prototype graphs by utilizing a two-step constrained language model generation based on semantically similar features within an ontology. The resulting prototype graph serves as the building block for further user refinements within a dedicated visual query builder. Our approach consistently generates a valid SPARQL query within the constraints imposed by the ontology, without requiring any additional corrections to the syntax or classes and links used. Unlike related language models approaches, which often require multiple iterations to fix invalid syntax, non-existent classes, and non-existent links, our approach achieves this consistently. We evaluate the performance of our system using graph retrieval on synthetic queries, comparing multiple metrics, models, and ontologies.

Traditional symbolic planners need these details to be written explicitly, which is time consuming and often incomplete. In this project we combine a Large Language Model with symbolic planning. Given a natural language task, the LLM suggests plausible preconditions and subgoals. We translate these suggestions into a formal planning model and execute the resulting plan in simulation.

Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio may expand in multiple directions when stretched and enable conformable interfaces. Here we demonstrate reconfigurable auxetic lattices for robotic surface manipulation. Our approach enables shape control through reconfigurable locking or embedded servos that underactuate an auxetic lattice structure. Variable expansion of local lattice areas is enabled by backlash between unit cells. Demonstrations of variable surface conformity are presented with characterization metrics.

We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

Yet, empirical findings on the effectiveness of LLMs in persuasion compared to humans remain inconsistent. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analytically assess whether LLMs differ from humans in persuasive effectiveness. We identified $7$ studies with 17,422 participants primarily recruited from English-speaking countries and $12$ effect size estimates. Egger's test indicated potential small-study effects ($p = .018$), but the trim-and-fill analysis did not impute any missing studies, suggesting a low risk of publication bias. We then compute the standardized effect sizes based on Hedges' $g$. The results show no significant overall difference in persuasive performance between LLMs and humans ($g = 0.02$, $p = .530$). However, we observe substantial heterogeneity across studies ($I^2 = 75.97\\%$), suggesting that persuasiveness strongly depends on contextual factors. In separate exploratory moderator analyses, no individual factor (e.g., LLM model, conversation design, or domain) reached statistical significance, which may be due to the limited number of studies. When considered jointly in a combined model, these factors explained a large proportion of the between-study variance ($R^2 = 81.93\\%$), and residual heterogeneity is low ($I^2 = 35.51\\%$). Although based on a small number of studies, this suggests that differences in LLM model, conversation design, and domain are important contextual factors in shaping persuasive performance, and that single-factor tests may understate their influence.

Systems that optimize only one link (data collection, simulation, learning, or deployment) rarely sustain improvement or generalize beyond narrow settings. We introduce Arcadia, a closed-loop framework that operationalizes embodied lifelong learning by tightly coupling four stages: (1) Self-evolving exploration and grounding for autonomous data acquisition in physical environments, (2) Generative scene reconstruction and augmentation for realistic and extensible scene creation, (3) a Shared embodied representation architecture that unifies navigation and manipulation within a single multimodal backbone, and (4) Sim-from-real evaluation and evolution that closes the feedback loop through simulation-based adaptation.

However, the psychological consequences of this trend are unknown. Here, we combined longitudinal randomised controlled trials (N=3,532) with a neural steering vector approach to precisely manipulate human exposure to relationship-seeking AI models over time. Dependence on a stimulus or activity can emerge under repeated exposure when \"liking\" (how engaging or pleasurable an experience may be) decouples from \"wanting\" (a desire to seek or continue it). We found evidence that this decoupling emerged over four weeks of exposure. Relationship-seeking AI had immediate but declining hedonic appeal, yet triggered growing markers of attachment and increased intentions to seek future AI companionship. The psychological impacts of AI followed non-linear dose-response curves, with moderately relationship-seeking AI maximising hedonic appeal and attachment. Despite signs of persistent \"wanting\", extensive AI use over a month conferred no discernible benefit to psychosocial health. These behavioural changes were accompanied by shifts in how users relate to and understand artificial intelligence: users viewed relationship-seeking AI relatively more like a friend than a tool and their beliefs on AI consciousness in general were shifted after a month of exposure.

This thesis addresses this issue by designing a novel hierarchical control architecture to improve humanoid locomotion stability with SLs. The core of this framework is a decoupled strategy that combines learning-based locomotion with model-based balancing. The low-level component consists of a walking gait for a Unitree H1 humanoid through imitation learning and curriculum learning. The high-level component actively utilizes the SLs for dynamic balancing. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in a physics-based simulation under three conditions: baseline gait for an unladen humanoid (baseline walking), walking with a static SL payload (static payload), and walking with the active dynamic balancing controller (dynamic balancing). Our evaluation shows that the dynamic balancing controller improves stability. Compared to the static payload condition, the balancing strategy yields a gait pattern closer to the baseline and decreases the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of the CoM trajectory by 47\\%. The balancing controller also improves the re-stabilization within gait cycles and achieves a more coordinated anti-phase pattern of Ground Reaction Forces (GRF). The results demonstrate that a decoupled, hierarchical design can effectively mitigate the internal dynamic disturbances arising from the mass and movement of the SLs, enabling stable locomotion for humanoids equipped with functional limbs.

We introduce Hyper-GoalNet, a framework that generates task-specific policy network parameters from goal specifications using hypernetworks. Unlike conventional methods that simply condition fixed networks on goal-state pairs, our approach separates goal interpretation from state processing -- the former determines network parameters while the latter applies these parameters to current observations. To enhance representation quality for effective policy generation, we implement two complementary constraints on the latent space: (1) a forward dynamics model that promotes state transition predictability, and (2) a distance-based constraint ensuring monotonic progression toward goal states. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive suite of manipulation tasks with varying environmental randomization. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-variability conditions.

We achieve social competence by looking around at our peers, decoding subtle cues from bystanders - a raised eyebrow, a laugh - to evaluate the environment and our actions. Robots, however, struggle to perceive and make use of these nuanced reactions. By employing a novel neck-mounted device that records facial expressions from the chin region, we explore the potential of previously untapped data to capture and interpret human responses to robot error. First, we develop NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model to map the reactions captured through the chin camera onto facial points and head motion. We then use these facial responses to develop a robot error detection model which outperforms standard methodologies such as using OpenFace or video data, generalizing well especially for within-participant data.

Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations further increases the success rate by an average of 25% over the vision-only baseline, validating the fidelity and utility of the dataset.

Conventional productivity tools typically demand sustained self-discipline and consistent use, which many students struggle with, leading to disruptive app-switching behaviors. Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), known for their intuitive and interactive nature, offer promising potential to support productivity in academic environments, having been successfully utilized in domains like education, cognitive development, and mental health. To leverage SARs effectively in addressing student productivity, this study employed a Participatory Design (PD) approach, directly involving college students and a Student Success and Well-Being Coach in the design process. Through interviews and a collaborative workshop, we gathered detailed insights on productivity challenges and identified desirable features for a productivity-focused SAR.

To address this limitation, we propose integrating motion planners with Doppler LiDARs which provide not only ranging measurements but also instantaneous point velocities. However, this integration is nontrivial due to the dual requirements of high accuracy and high frequency. To this end, we introduce Doppler Planning Network (DPNet), which tracks and reacts to rapid obstacles using Doppler model-based learning. Particularly, we first propose a Doppler Kalman neural network (D-KalmanNet) to track the future states of obstacles under partially observable Gaussian state space model. We then leverage the estimated motions to construct a Doppler-tuned model predictive control (DT-MPC) framework for ego-motion planning, enabling runtime auto-tuning of the controller parameters. These two model-based learners allow DPNet to maintain lightweight while learning fast environmental changes using minimum data, and achieve both high frequency and high accuracy in tracking and planning.

A key challenge lies in achieving both efficiency, by minimizing total mission cost, and fairness, by balancing the workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents. This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. For each UAV, collision-free trajectories are generated using A* search over a terrain-aware configuration space.

However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction. This threshold is the empirical $(1-\u03b1)$ quantile of on-policy calibration scores, providing a distribution-free calibration rule that links $\u03b1$ to the expected query rate and makes $\u03b1$ a task-agnostic tuning knob. This state-space querying strategy is robust to outliers and, unlike safety-gate-based AIL, can be run without real-time expert takeovers: we roll out full trajectories (episodes) with the learner and only afterward query the expert on a subset of visited states. Evaluated on MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches or exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and up to 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with empirical robustness to $\u03b1$ and $K$, easing deployment on novel systems with unknown dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRSAIL\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u884c\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728GPU\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3aCRSAIL\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u7b2cK\u4e2a\u6700\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5168\u7403\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCRSAIL\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u8d85\u51fa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6bd4DAgger\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684AIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6700\u591a96%\u548c65%\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "CRSAIL\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

These challenges arise in many robotics domains, from urban driving and warehouse automation to defense and surveillance. Classical path planning approaches and memoryless reinforcement learning often fail under limited fields of view (FoVs) and occlusions, committing to unsafe or inefficient maneuvers. We propose a hierarchical navigation framework that integrates a Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) as a high-level subgoal selector with a modular low-level controller for waypoint execution. The DTQN consumes short histories of task-aware features, encoding odometry, goal direction, obstacle proximity, and visibility cues, and outputs Q-values to rank candidate subgoals. Visibility-aware candidate generation introduces masking and exposure penalties, rewarding the use of cover and anticipatory safety. A low-level potential field controller then tracks the selected subgoal, ensuring smooth short-horizon obstacle avoidance. We validate our approach in 2D simulation and extend it directly to a 3D Unity-ROS environment by projecting point-cloud perception into the same feature schema, enabling transfer without architectural changes. Results show consistent improvements over classical planners and RL baselines in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal, with ablations confirming the value of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design.

This work introduces MS-PPO, a morphological-symmetry-equivariant policy learning framework that encodes robot kinematic structure and morphological symmetries directly into the policy network. We construct a morphology-informed graph neural architecture that is provably equivariant with respect to the robot's morphological symmetry group actions, ensuring consistent policy responses under symmetric states while maintaining invariance in value estimation. This design eliminates the need for tedious reward shaping or costly data augmentation, which are typically required to enforce symmetry. We evaluate MS-PPO in simulation on Unitree Go2 and Xiaomi CyberDog2 robots across diverse locomotion tasks, including trotting, pronking, slope walking, and bipedal turning, and further deploy the learned policies on hardware. Extensive experiments show that MS-PPO achieves superior training stability, symmetry generalization ability, and sample efficiency in challenging locomotion tasks, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These findings demonstrate that embedding both kinematic structure and morphological symmetry into policy learning provides a powerful inductive bias for legged robot locomotion control.

The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments.

Unlike systems relying on attached sensors or treating sensing and actuation separately, SoftMag unifies them through a shared architecture while confronting the mechanical parasitic effect, where deformations corrupt tactile signals. A multiphysics simulation framework models this coupling, and a neural-network-based decoupling strategy removes the parasitic component, restoring sensing fidelity. Experiments including indentation, quasi-static and step actuation, and fatigue tests validate the actuator's performance and decoupling effectiveness. Building upon this foundation, the system is extended into a two-finger SoftMag gripper, where a multi-task neural network enables real-time prediction of tri-axial contact forces and position. Furthermore, a probing-based strategy estimates object firmness during grasping. Validation on apricots shows a strong correlation (Pearson r over 0.8) between gripper-estimated firmness and reference measurements, confirming the system's capability for non-destructive quality assessment. Results demonstrate that combining integrated magnetic sensing, learning-based correction, and real-time inference enables a soft robotic platform that adapts its grasp and quantifies material properties.

One of the key barriers is the lack of motion planning algorithms that can provide verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency and reliability. To address this, a family of algorithms called Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) was introduced, which leverages a preprocessing phase to enable collision-free motion queries in a fixed, user-specified time budget (e.g., 10 milliseconds). However, existing CTMP methods do not explicitly incorporate the manipulation behaviors essential for object handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \\textit{Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner} (B-CTMP), an algorithm that extends CTMP to solve a broad class of two-step manipulation tasks: (1) a collision-free motion to a behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of a manipulation behavior (such as grasping or insertion) to reach the goal. By precomputing compact data structures, B-CTMP guarantees constant-time query in mere milliseconds while ensuring completeness and successful task execution over a specified set of states. We evaluate B-CTMP on two canonical manipulation tasks in simulation, shelf picking and plug insertion,and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real robot. Our results show that B-CTMP unifies collision-free planning and object manipulation within a single constant-time framework, providing provable guarantees of speed and success for manipulation in semi-structured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "B-CTMP\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff08CTMP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u7684\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u811a\u672c\u4f8b\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u884c\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08B-CTMP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86B-CTMP\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8d27\u67b6\u6311\u9009\u548c\u63d2\u5934\u63d2\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "B-CTMP\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Traditional sensing modalities such as visual cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) fail in environments with poor visibility due to darkness, smoke, or reflective surfaces. In these visioned-impaired conditions, UWB radar offers a promising alternative. To this end, this work explores the suitability of robot-mounted UWB radar for environmental mapping in dynamic, anchor-free scenarios. The study investigates how different materials (metal, concrete and plywood) and UWB radio channels (5 and 9) influence the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). Furthermore, a processing pipeline is proposed to achieve reliable mapping of detected obstacles, consisting of 3 steps: (i) target identification (based on CIR peak detection), (ii) filtering (based on peak properties, signal-to-noise score, and phase-difference of arrival), and (iii) clustering (based on distance estimation and angle-of-arrival estimation). The proposed approach successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, resulting in an obstacle detection precision of at least 82.36% and a recall of 89.46% on channel 9 even when detecting low-reflective materials such as plywood.

These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

However, most available quadruped robots are primarily focused on mobility without object manipulation capabilities. Equipping a quadruped robot with a robotic arm and gripper introduces a challenge in manual control, especially in remote scenarios that require complex commands. This research aims to develop an autonomous grasping system on a quadruped robot using a task-level interaction approach. The system includes hardware integration of a robotic arm and gripper onto the quadruped robot's body, a layered control system designed using ROS, and a web-based interface for human-robot interaction. The robot is capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigation, object detection, and grasping using GraspNet. Testing was conducted through real-world scenarios to evaluate navigation, object selection and grasping, and user experience.

Building on these advances, we develop a teacher-student-bootstrap learning framework for vision-based humanoid loco-manipulation, using articulated-object interaction as a representative high-difficulty benchmark. Our approach introduces a staged-reset exploration strategy that stabilizes long-horizon privileged-policy training, and a GRPO-based fine-tuning procedure that mitigates partial observability and improves closed-loop consistency in sim-to-real RL. Trained entirely on simulation data, the resulting policy achieves robust zero-shot performance across diverse door types and outperforms human teleoperators by up to 31.7% in task completion time under the same whole-body control stack.

This problem becomes further complicated in the presence of sensor noise because noisy sensors provide, at best, incomplete information, which results in a distribution over target states to be intercepted. Since time is of the essence, to hit the target, the planner must begin directing the interceptor, in this case a robot arm, while still receiving information. We introduce an tree-like structure, which is grown using kinodynamic motion primitives in state-time space. This tree-like structure encodes reachability to multiple goals from a single origin, while enabling real-time value updates as the target belief evolves and seamless transitions between goals.

Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to \"privileged\" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a \"generalist\" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

While single-drone tracking systems have been extensively studied, swarm-based target tracking remains underexplored, despite its unique advantages of distributed perception, fault-tolerant redundancy, and multidirectional target coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel decentralized LiDAR-based swarm tracking framework that enables visibility-aware, cooperative target tracking in complex environments, while fully harnessing the unique capabilities of swarm systems. To address visibility, we introduce a novel Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF)-based metric for 3-D environmental occlusion representation, coupled with an efficient algorithm that enables real-time onboard SSDF updating. A general Field-of-View (FOV) alignment cost supporting heterogeneous LiDAR configurations is proposed for consistent target observation. Swarm coordination is enhanced through cooperative costs that enforce inter-robot safe clearance, prevent mutual occlusions, and notably facilitate 3-D multidirectional target encirclement via a novel electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical planner, combining a kinodynamic front-end searcher with a spatiotemporal $SE(3)$ back-end optimizer to generate collision-free, visibility-optimized trajectories.Deployed on heterogeneous LiDAR swarms, our fully decentralized implementation features collaborative perception, distributed planning, and dynamic swarm reconfigurability.

Despite many successes, due to their morphology, dynamics and limitation of control policy, humanoid robots are prone to fall as compared to other embodiments like quadruped or wheeled robots.

Existing researches in this field mostly focus on using control based methods that struggle to cater diverse falling scenarios and may introduce unsuitable human prior. On the other hand, large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning could be employed to incentivize humanoid agent discovering falling protection policy that fits its own nature and property. In this work, with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum, we successfully train humanoid agent to explore falling protection behaviors and discover that by forming a `triangle' structure, the falling damages could be significantly reduced with its rigid-material body.

This challenge is particularly pronounced for objects made of glass, metal, or other materials whose transparent or reflective surfaces introduce severe out-of-distribution variations. Existing approaches either rely on simulated materials in simulators and perform sim-to-real transfer, which is hindered by substantial visual domain gaps, or depend on collecting extensive real-world demonstrations, which is costly, time-consuming, and still insufficient to cover various materials. To overcome these limitations, we resort to computational photography and introduce Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), a unified framework that leverages the physical characteristics of materials as captured by light transport for photometric re-rendering. The core idea is simple yet powerful: given a single real-world demonstration, we photometrically re-render the scene to generate a diverse set of highly realistic demonstrations with different material properties. This augmentation effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling policies to generalize across materials without additional data collection. To systematically evaluate this capability, we construct the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark spanning both simulation and real-world environments.

Existing agents often struggle with robust long-term planning about unseen environments, leading to high failure rates. To address these limitations, we introduce NavForesee, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) that unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination within a single, unified framework. Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones.

This paper proposes a novel one-key calibration framework named L2M-Calib for a fused magnetic-LiDAR system, jointly estimating the extrinsic transformation between the two kinds of sensors and the intrinsic distortion parameters of the magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field (AMF) patterns, which are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them suitable for challenging environments. Nonetheless, the integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems remains underexplored due to the absence of effective calibration techniques. To address this, we optimize extrinsic parameters using an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme, coupled with the intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem, ensuring robustness against measurement noise and ill-conditioned data.

Established YCB and NIST benchmarks quantify grasp success, force, or timing on a single platform, but do not evaluate cross-embodiment transferability or energy-aware performance, capabilities essential for modern mobile and aerial manipulation. This letter introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), a compact and reproducible benchmarking suite extending YCB and selected NIST metrics with three additional components: a transfer-time benchmark measuring the practical effort required to exchange embodiments, an energy-consumption benchmark evaluating grasping and holding efficiency, and an intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent operational capability. Together, these metrics characterize both grasp performance and the suitability of reusing a single gripper across heterogeneous robotic systems. A lightweight self-locking gripper prototype is implemented as a reference case. Experiments demonstrate rapid embodiment transfer (median ~= 17.6 s across user groups), low holding energy for gripper prototype (~= 1.5 J per 10 s), and consistent grasp performance with cycle times of 3.2 - 3.9 s and success rates exceeding 90%.

However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion.

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction.

However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data.

Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.", "AI": {"tldr": "GR-RL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u7a7f\u978b\u5e26\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387 83.3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 VLA \u653f\u7b56\u5047\u8bbe\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cbe\u7ec6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u5608\u6742\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "GR-RL \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "GR-RL \u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u978b\u5e26\u7a7f\u773c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe 83.3%\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GR-RL \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7cbe\u7ec6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u5230 83.3%\u3002"}}

There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection.

We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\\% and reduces collisions by 54\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoaD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u6eda\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u95ed\u73af\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u5f15\u5165RoaD\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "RoaD\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u56de\u6eda\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728WOSAC\u548cAlpaSim\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRoaD\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8641%\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8654%\u3002", "conclusion": "RoaD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating se- mantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6216\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73af\u5883\u914d\u7f6e\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u7f6e\u4e00\u4e2a\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u62df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6216\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002"}}

However, progress remains limited by the difficulty of simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, especially tactile feedback. In this work, we propose \\ours, a sim-to-real framework that addresses these limitations and demonstrates its effectiveness on nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving with multi-fingered hands. The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the \"how\" process from the \"what\" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training.

We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories.
