This systematic review synthesizes (1) the behavior change strategies used in existing HRI studies employing social robots to promote health behavior change, and (2) the evaluation methods applied to assess behavior change outcomes. Relevant literature was identified through systematic database searches and hand searches. Analysis of 39 studies revealed four overarching categories of behavior change strategies: coaching strategies, counseling strategies, social influence strategies, and persuasion-enhancing strategies. These strategies highlight the unique affordances of social robots as behavior change interventions and offer valuable design heuristics. The review also identified key characteristics of current evaluation practices, including study designs, settings, durations, and outcome measures, on the basis of which we propose several directions for future HRI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u63a2\u8ba8\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf939\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c31\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u5230\u89d2\u9b5f\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5fae\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u78c1\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u6c34\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6e38\u6cf3\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6e38\u6cf3\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5c0f\u5de7\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5fae\u521b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5236\u9020\u53d7\u5230\u89d2\u9b5f\u6e38\u6cf3\u539f\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5177\u6709\u78c1\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5fae\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u8d6b\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u7ebf\u5708\u751f\u6210\u632f\u8361\u78c1\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u6e38\u6cf3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6cf3\u901f\u5728B = 5 mT\u548cf = 11 Hz\u65f6\u6700\u5feb\uff0c\u8fbe\u52305.25 mm/s\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7535\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6e38\u6cf3\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u6c34\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots.

By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships.

Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics.

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5229\u7528MCP\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6574\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u6307\u6325\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684Linux\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u642d\u5efa\u652f\u6301Mavlink\u534f\u8bae\u7684MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u98de\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While historic cities such as Edinburgh, as the capital of Scotland, often feature well-established public transport systems, urban accessibility challenges remain and are exacerbated by a complex landscape, especially for groups with multiple vulnerabilities such as the blind elderly. With limited research examining how real-time data feeds and developments in artificial intelligence can enhance navigation aids, we address this gap through a mixed-methods approach. Our work combines statistical and machine learning techniques, with a focus on spatial analysis to investigate network coverage, service patterns, and density through live Transport for Edinburgh data, with a qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the mentioned target group. The results demonstrate the highly centralised nature of the city's transport system, the significance of memory-based navigation, and the lack of travel information in usable formats. We also find that participants already use navigation technology to varying degrees and express a willingness to adopt artificial intelligence.

In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations.

Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as \"black boxes,\" lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a \"model-calibration bottleneck\", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace.

This study empirically explores how disabled students perceive robot-based support, comparing two interaction roles, one information based (signposting) and one disclosure based (sounding board), and two embodiment types (physical robot/disembodied voice agent). Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy.

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c0f\u578b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0e\u6e90\u5bfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ffd\u8e2a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u5bb3\u6392\u653e\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6c14\u4f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c14\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u201c\u6295\u63b7\u4e0e\u51b2\u523a\u201d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c14\u6d41\u5e76\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u671d\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u627e\u5230\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6c14\u4f53\u8e2a\u6e90\u548c\u6c14\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Aerial robots offer superior maneuverability and search efficiency, but they also introduce new challenges in spatial perception, dynamic control, and safety assurance. In this paper, we propose AION for vision-based aerial ObjectNav without relying on external localization or global maps. AION is an end-to-end dual-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework that decouples exploration and goal-reaching behaviors into two specialized policies. We evaluate AION on the AI2-THOR benchmark and further assess its real-time performance in IsaacSim using high-fidelity drone models.

This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863-DOF\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u60a3\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKronecker\u79ef\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408D-optimal\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u59ff\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3PPO\u4ee3\u7406\u9009\u62e94\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPPO\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u56db\u4e2a\u59ff\u52bf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u8de8\u56de\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6765\u81ea50\u4e2a\u59ff\u52bf\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions.

To promote safer and more predictable interaction in dynamic flight, Glove2UAV is designed as a lightweight and easily deployable wearable interface intended for real-time operation. Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights.

Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection.

In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism.

TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control.

Personal use is permitted. All other uses require IEEE permission", "summary": "Accurate calibration and robust localization are fundamental for downstream tasks in spinning actuated LiDAR applications. Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

Through interviews with 16 mental health professionals and 6 general users, we aim to uncover tensions and design opportunities in this emerging space to guide responsible self-clone design.

While human athletes can effectively perceive environmental characteristics to select appropriate footholds for obstacle traversal, endowing legged robots with similar perceptual reasoning remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on hierarchical controllers that follow pre-computed footholds, thereby constraining the robot's real-time adaptability and the exploratory potential of reinforcement learning. To overcome these challenges, we present PUMA, an end-to-end learning framework that integrates visual perception and foothold priors into a single-stage training process. This approach leverages terrain features to estimate egocentric polar foothold priors, composed of relative distance and heading, guiding the robot in active posture adaptation for parkour tasks.

Thus, a motivational tension that is not informed by needs alone, but also by emotions, intention, goals and means to achieve them is therefore generated within the mental, emotional and physical plane. Based on Montserrat's opinion (2004: 131), that \"to motivate means, above all, to move and to transmit an emotion\", we will undertake to identify the mutual influences between emotions and motivation. The main objectives of this article are to display a summary of the theories and definitions about emotions and to explore the links between emotions and motivation. Although interconnected, emotions and motivation can be contemplated from a double perspective: (1) emotions influence motivation and (2) motivation influences emotions. Moreover, we will consider motivation from three dimensions: (1) cognitive, (2) affective and (3) volitional. The ultimate purpose of this article is to issue a warning as to the importance of the emotional side of motivation.

To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles.

Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2dSE2(3)\u7fa4\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u81ea\u6cbb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5730\u7403\u81ea\u8f6c\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u8bbe\u5907\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7ef4\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u60ef\u6027\u3001\u5730\u7403\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSE2(3)\u7fa4\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7684SE2(3)\u7fa4\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u901f\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u79d1\u6c0f\u529b\u9879\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u975e\u60ef\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdSE2(3)\u7fa4\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u3002"}}

Social robots have shown promise in reducing anxiety through emotional support, yet how such systems should balance psychological safety with effective instructional guidance remains an open question. In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative. Quantitative measures further showed significant reductions in interview-related social and communication anxiety, while maintaining high perceived warmth and therapeutic alliance. We synthesize these findings into an Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem framework, highlighting user agency as a key mechanism for balancing emotional support and instructional guidance in social robot coaching systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9762\u8bd5\u7126\u8651\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u6c42\u804c\u9762\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7126\u8651\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u81ea\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u4e92\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9762\u8bd5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u7126\u8651\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u6e29\u6696\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u8054\u76df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u67b6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u6027\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We implemented embodied journaling in virtual reality and conducted a within-subject user study (n=20) to explore the emergent behaviours from the process and to compare its expressive and reflective qualities to those of written journaling. When writing-based norms and affordances were absent, we found that participants defaulted towards unfiltered emotional expression, often forgoing words altogether.

We present StreetDesignAI, an interactive system that enables designers to (1) ground evaluation in street context through imagery and map data, (2) receive parallel feedback from cyclist personas spanning confident to cautious users, and (3) iteratively modify designs while surfacing conflicts across perspectives. A within-subjects study with 26 transportation professionals demonstrates that structured multi-perspective feedback significantly improves designers' understanding of diverse user perspectives, ability to identify persona needs, and confidence in translating them into design decisions, with higher satisfaction and stronger intention for professional adoption. Qualitative findings reveal how conflict surfacing transforms design exploration from single-perspective optimization toward deliberate trade-off reasoning. We discuss implications for AI tools that scaffold inclusive design through disagreement as an interaction primitive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faStreetDesignAI\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u65f6\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5e38\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u89c1\u4e0d\u540c\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aStreetDesignAI\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5728\u8857\u9053\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u53cd\u9988\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9879\u5305\u542b26\u540d\u4ea4\u901a\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u53cd\u9988\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u91c7\u7eb3\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e7f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%).

Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 25 pages", "summary": "Bio-digital systems that merge microbial life with technology promise new modes of computation, combining biological adaptability with digital precision. Yet realizing this potential symbiotically -- where biological and digital agents co-adapt and co-process -- remains elusive, largely due to the absence of a shared vocabulary bridging biology and computing. Consequently, microbes are often constrained to uni-directional roles, functioning as sensors or actuators rather than as active, computational partners in bio-digital systems. In response, we propose a taxonomy and pathways that articulate and expand the roles of biological and digital entities for synergetic bio-digital computation. Using this taxonomy, we analysed 70 systems across HCI, design, and engineering, identifying how biological mechanisms can be mapped onto computational abstractions. We argue that such mappings enable computationally actionable directions that foster richer and reciprocal relationships in bio-digital systems, supporting regenerative ecologies across time and scale while inspiring new paradigms for computation in HCI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u7269\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5bcc\u6709\u751f\u6001\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u7269\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u540c\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5bf970\u4e2a\u751f\u7269-\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u62bd\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u751f\u7269-\u6570\u5b57\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u591a\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u751f\u6001\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7269-\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u7269\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u53d1\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Yet, dominant alignment approaches remain model centric, treating users as passive recipients of prespecified values rather than as epistemic agents who encounter and respond to misalignment during interactions. Drawing on situated perspectives, we frame alignment as an interactional practice co-constructed during human AI interaction. We investigate how users understand and wish to contribute to this process through a participatory workshop that combines misalignment diaries with generative design activities. We surface how misalignments materialise in practice and how users envision acting on them, grounded in the context of researchers using Large Language Models as research assistants. Our findings show that misalignments are experienced less as abstract ethical violations than as unexpected responses, and task or social breakdowns. Participants articulated roles ranging from adjusting and interpreting model behaviour to deliberate non-engagement as an alignment strategy. We conclude with implications for designing systems that support alignment as an ongoing, situated, and shared practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u6237\u5982\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u4e3a\u610f\u5916\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u800c\u5efa\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5728AI\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79ef\u6781\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u770b\u5f85\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e5\u8bb0\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8d21\u732e\u610f\u613f\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u5230\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u662f\u610f\u5916\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u793e\u4ea4\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6545\u610f\u4e0d\u53c2\u4e0e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u7684\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

Victims experience various types of harm after cybercrimes, including monetary loss, data breaches, negative emotions, and even psychological trauma. The aspects that support their recovery process and contribute to individual cyber resilience remain underinvestigated. To address this gap, we interviewed 18 cybercrime victims from Western Europe using a trauma-informed approach. We identified four common stages following victimization: recognition, coping, processing, and recovery. Participants adopted various strategies to mitigate the impact of cybercrime and used different indicators to describe recovery. While they mostly relied on social support and self-regulation for emotional coping, service providers largely determined whether victims were able to recover their money. Internal factors, external support, and context sensitivity collectively contribute to individuals' cyber resilience. We recommend trauma-informed support for cybercrime victims.
