We focus on the case of AI perceptions, which are generally assessed via a single quantitative or qualitative measure, or with a mixed methods approach that compares two distinct data sources - e.g. a quantitative questionnaire with qualitative comments. To compare different approaches, we collect two forms of qualitative data: standalone comments and structured focus groups. We conduct two analyses for each data source: with a sentiment and stance analysis, we measure overall negativity/positivity of the comments and focus group conversations, respectively. Meanwhile, word clouds from the comments and a thematic analysis of the focus groups provide further detail on the content of this qualitative data - particularly the thematic analysis, which includes both similarities and differences between students and staff. We show that different analyses can produce different results - for a single data source. This variation stems from the construct being evaluated - an overall measure of positivity/negativity can produce a different picture from more detailed content-based analyses. We discuss the implications of this variation for institutional contexts, and for the comparisons from previous studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u751f\u4e0e\u5458\u5de5\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u770b\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u673a\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u5458\u5de5\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7126\u70b9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u7acb\u573a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bcd\u4e91\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u79ef\u6781\u6027/\u6d88\u6781\u6027\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7ec6\u81f4\u5206\u6790\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u5458\u5de5\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u65f6\u3002"}}

This is particularly true in the field of cultural heritage, where the number of open datasets is relatively limited and where the data collected does not always allow for holistic modeling of visitors' experience due to the fact that data are ad hoc (i.e. restricted to the sole characteristics required for the evaluation of a specific model). To overcome this lack, we conducted a study between February and March 2019 aimed at obtaining comprehensive and detailed information about visitors, their visit experience and their feedback. We equipped 51 participants with eye-tracking glasses, leaving them free to explore the 3 floors of the museum for an average of 57 minutes, and to discover an exhibition of more than 400 artworks. On this basis, we built an open dataset combining contextual data (demographic data, preferences, visiting habits, motivations, social context. . . ), behavioral data (spatiotemporal trajectories, gaze data) and feedback (satisfaction, fatigue, liked artworks, verbatim. . . ). Our analysis made it possible to re-enact visitor identities combining the majority of characteristics found in the literature and to reproduce the Veron and Levasseur profiles. This dataset will ultimately make it possible to improve the quality of recommended paths in museums by personalizing the number of points of interest (POIs), the time spent at these different POIs, and the amount of information to be provided to each visitor based on their level of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bbf\u5ba2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u535a\u7269\u9986\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u6e38\u5ba2\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u773c\u955c\u6536\u96c6\u6e38\u5ba2\u5728\u535a\u7269\u9986\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u504f\u597d\u3001\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e60\u60ef\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u73b0\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u6e38\u5ba2\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u535a\u7269\u9986\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584\u535a\u7269\u9986\u63a8\u8350\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6e38\u5ba2\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Automated approaches offer efficiency but often lack transparency, while human verification remains slow and inconsistent. We introduce Althea, a retrieval-augmented system that integrates question generation, evidence retrieval, and structured reasoning to support user-driven evaluation of online claims. On the AVeriTeC benchmark, Althea achieves a Macro-F1 of 0.44, outperforming standard verification pipelines and improving discrimination between supported and refuted claims. We further evaluate Althea through a controlled user study and a longitudinal survey experiment (N = 642), comparing three interaction modes that vary in the degree of scaffolding: an Exploratory mode with guided reasoning, a Summary mode providing synthesized verdicts, and a Self-search mode that offers procedural guidance without algorithmic intervention. Results show that guided interaction produces the strongest immediate gains in accuracy and confidence, while self-directed search yields the most persistent improvements over time. This pattern suggests that performance gains are not driven solely by effort or exposure, but by how cognitive work is structured and internalized.", "AI": {"tldr": "Althea\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Althea\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728AVeriTeC\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cAlthea\u7684Macro-F1\u8fbe\u52300.44\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5bf9\u652f\u6301\u548c\u53cd\u9a73\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Althea\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u58f0\u660e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as \"state drift\" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NeuroKalman\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bfc\u822a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u6539\u5584\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6NeuroKalman\uff0c\u5c06\u5bfc\u822a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6839\u636e\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728TravelUAV\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf910%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cNeuroKalman\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u5236\u6f02\u79fb\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroKalman\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5148\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

As AI is used alongside human instructors, understanding these attribution effects is essential for designing effective hybrid AI-human educational systems. We designed a creative coding interface that isolates source attribution while controlling for content: all participants receive identical LLM-generated feedback, but half see it attributed to AI and half to a human teaching assistant (TA). We found two key results. First, perceived feedback source affected engagement: learners in the TA condition spent significantly more time and effort (d = 0.88-1.56) despite receiving identical feedback. Second, perceptions differed: AI-attributed feedback ratings were predicted by prior trust in AI (r = 0.85), while TA-attributed ratings were predicted by perceived genuineness (r = 0.65).

Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08H-WM\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u72ec\u7acb\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08H-WM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u903b\u8f91\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684H-WM\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This has sparked growing efforts in building and benchmarking AI's ToM capability, yet little is known about how such capability could translate into the design and experience of everyday user-facing AI products and services. We conducted 13 co-design sessions with 26 U.S.-based AI practitioners to envision, reflect, and distill design recommendations for ToM-enabled everyday AI products and services that are both future-looking and grounded in the realities of AI design and development practices. Analysis revealed three interrelated design recommendations: ToM-enabled AI should 1) be situated in the social context that shape users' mental states, 2) be responsive to the dynamic nature of mental states, and 3) be attuned to subjective individual differences. We surface design tensions within each recommendation that reveal a broader gap between practitioners' envisioned futures of ToM-enabled AI and the realities of current AI design and development practices.

However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ExtremControl\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f350ms\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86200ms\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u793a\u662f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6ExtremControl\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd0\u7528\u9009\u5b9a\u521a\u4f53\u94fe\u7684SE(3)\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u8f6c\u6362\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u94fe\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u901f\u5ea6\u524d\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u81f350ms\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5149\u5b66\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u9988\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u4e52\u4e53\u7403\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6742\u800d\u3002", "conclusion": "ExtremControl\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 humanoid \u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Drawing on interviews with tarot practitioners and Hartmut Rosa's Theory of Resonance, we investigate how users seek, negotiate, and evaluate resonant interpretations in a context where no causal relationship exists between the query and the data being interpreted. We identify distinct ways practitioners incorporate AI into their interpretive workflows, including using AI to navigate uncertainty and self-doubt, explore alternative perspectives, and streamline or extend existing divinatory practices.

The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \\r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

By synthesizing existing research, the model offers a structured approach to studying interactions with GSAs, supporting the development of agents that motivate rather than manipulate humans.

Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4ef7\u503c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f20\u9012\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u70b9\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684Soft Actor Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u65e2\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Although the dynamical systems approach (DSA) has provided valuable insights into addressing this issue, its application has largely been confined to cyclic or simplified motor movements. To overcome this limitation, the present study employs neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) to model the time evolution of non-cyclic full-body movements as a low-dimensional latent dynamical system. Given the temporal complexity full-body kinematic chains, baseball pitching was selected as a representative target movement to examine whether DSA could be extended to more complex, ecologically valid human movements. Results of the verification experiment demonstrated that the time evolution of a complex pitching motion could be accurately predicted (R^2 > 0.45) using the NODE-based dynamical model. Notably, approximately 50% of the variance in the latter half of the pitching motion was explained using only the initial ~8% of the temporal sequence, underscoring how subsequent movement evolves from initial conditions according to ODE-defined dynamics in latent space. These findings indicate the potential to extend the DSA to more complex and ecologically valid forms of human movement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68d2\u7403\u6295\u7403\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6216\u7b80\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08NODEs\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u68d2\u7403\u6295\u7403\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540e\u534a\u90e8\u5206\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea650%\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb8%\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NODEs\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DSA\uff09\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u5982\u68d2\u7403\u6295\u7403\u3002"}}

This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

A level 3 ADS prompts the driver to take control by issuing a request to intervene (RtI) when its operational design domains (ODD) are exceeded. However, complex traffic situations can cause drivers to perceive multiple potential triggers of RtI simultaneously, causing hesitation or confusion during take-over. Therefore, drivers need to clearly understand the ADS's system limitations to ensure safe take-over. This study proposes a voice-based educational human machine interface~(HMI) for providing RtI trigger cues and reason to help drivers understand ADS's system limitations. The results of a between-group experiment using a driving simulator showed that incorporating effective trigger cues and reason into the RtI was related to improved driver comprehension of the ADS's system limitations. Moreover, most participants, instructed via the proposed method, could proactively take over control of the ADS in cases where RtI fails; meanwhile, their number of collisions was lower compared with the other RtI HMI conditions. Therefore, using the proposed method to continually enhance the driver's understanding of the system limitations of ADS through the proposed method is associated with safer and more effective real-time interactions with ADS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u7684HMI\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7b49\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u9650\u5236\u9020\u53ca\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u63a5\u7ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5bf9RtI\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u591a\u91cd\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b9\u8c6b\u6216\u56f0\u60d1\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7406\u89e3ADS\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u63a5\u7ba1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u95f4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u4eba\u673a\u754c\u9762\uff08HMI\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u7406\u7531\u7684RtI\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5bf9ADS\u7cfb\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u5f3a\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5bf9ADS\u7cfb\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e0eADS\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object.

However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap.

Jin Kim"], "title": "ReaDy-Go: Real-to-Sim Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting Simulation for Environment-Specific Visual Navigation with Moving Obstacles", "comment": "Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/", "summary": "Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential.

While scholars have examined how individuals share near-death experiences (NDEs), limited research has explored how these narratives are communicated collaboratively on today's social media platforms. We analyzed 200 randomly sampled TikTok videos tagged with #nde and related hashtags. Content analysis revealed that individuals often use NDE narratives to articulate personal meaning, with spiritual and religious themes appearing in the majority of posts and serving as a means of exploring and making sense of personal spiritual perspectives. Consistent with this, analyses of comment sections reveal that videos containing spiritual themes tend to attract more engagement and foster deeper conversations around faith and meaning. Our findings offer insights into how online platforms facilitate community-level engagement with spirituality, and suggest implications for design of spaces that support shared expression and connection in specialized communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86TikTok\u4e0a\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d9\u8ff0\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7075\u6027\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08NDE\uff09\u53d9\u8ff0\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u4f20\u8fbe\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u4e2a\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u521b\u4f24\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u4fe1\u4ef0\u3002", "method": "\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790200\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u7684TikTok\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e3a#nde\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0NDE\u53d9\u8ff0\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u4eba\u751f\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7075\u6027\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u4e3b\u9898\u5360\u5927\u591a\u6570\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u66f4\u591a\u4e92\u52a8\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u4fe1\u4ef0\u548c\u610f\u4e49\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u7075\u6027\u793e\u533a\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528VR\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u4eba\u9645\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\uff09\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u6ce8\u89c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e(VR)\u773c\u955c\u6536\u96c641\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u65b9\u5411\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3LSTM\u548cTransformer\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u6ce8\u89c6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u52a8\u753b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cLSTM\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a67.6%\u548c70.4%\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a72%\u548c71.6%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u72ec\u7279\u5730\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728NAO\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u5377\u8bc4\u4f30275\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6c9f\u901a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

Existing methods frequently fail to systematically incorporate end-user perspectives, resulting in a misalignment between technological potentials and market relevance. This study proposes a novel decision support framework that bridges this gap by linking technological feasibility with fundamental human values. The framework integrates two distinct lenses: the engineering-based Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Schwartz's theory of basic human values. By combining these, the approach enables a structured exploration of how emerging technologies may satisfy diverse user motivations. To illustrate the framework's feasibility and insight potential, we conducted exploratory workshops with general consumers and internal experts at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc., analyzing four real-world technologies (two commercial successes and two failures). Two consistent patterns emerged: (1) internal experts identified a wider value landscape than consumers (vision gap), and (2) successful technologies exhibited a broader range of associated human values (value breadth), suggesting strategic foresight may underpin market success. This study contributes both a practical tool for early-stage R\\&D decision-making and a theoretical link between value theory and innovation outcomes.

Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts.

Project page: https://lab-of-ai-and-robotics.github.io/LAMP/", "summary": "Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAMP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5730\u56fe\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u542b\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u5230\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7ec6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "LAMP\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u56fe\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "LAMP\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Detecting harmful content at early stages is essential for understanding and potentially mitigating its downstream spread. In this study, we introduce USE24-XD, a large-scale dataset of nearly 100k posts collected from X (formerly Twitter) during the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle, enriched with spatio-temporal metadata. To substantially reduce the cost of manual annotation while enabling scalable categorization, we employ six large language models (LLMs) to systematically annotate posts across five nuanced categories: Conspiracy, Sensationalism, Hate Speech, Speculation, and Satire. We validate LLM annotations with crowdsourcing (n = 34) and benchmark them against human annotators. Inter-rater reliability analyses show comparable agreement patterns between LLMs and humans, with LLMs exhibiting higher internal consistency and achieving up to 0.90 recall on Speculation. We apply a wisdom-of-the-crowd approach across LLMs to aggregate annotations and curate a robust multi-label dataset. 60% of posts receive at least one label. We further analyze how human annotator demographics, including political ideology and affiliation, shape labeling behavior, highlighting systematic sources of subjectivity in judgments of harmful content.

This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects.

VIRENA (Virtual Arena) is a platform that enables controlled experimentation in realistic social media environments. Multiple participants interact simultaneously in realistic replicas of feed-based platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Reddit) and messaging apps (WhatsApp, Messenger). Large language model-powered AI agents participate alongside humans with configurable personas and realistic behavior. Researchers can manipulate content moderation approaches, pre-schedule stimulus content, and run experiments across conditions through a visual interface requiring no programming skills. VIRENA makes possible research designs that were previously impractical: studying human--AI interaction in realistic social contexts, experimentally comparing moderation interventions, and observing group deliberation as it unfolds. Built on open-source technologies that ensure data remain under institutional control and comply with data protection requirements, VIRENA is currently in use at the University of Zurich and available for pilot collaborations. Designed for researchers, educators, and public organizations alike, VIRENA's no-code interface makes controlled social media simulation accessible across disciplines and sectors.

While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a \"blind spot\" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift.

However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning.

ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior.

Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models.

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives.

One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6253\u5305\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u7269\u54c1\u5df2\u90e8\u5206\u586b\u5145\u65f6\u7684\u6253\u5305\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ed3\u5e93\u64cd\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5371\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5206\u62e3\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7269\u54c1\u4ee5\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u5f62\u5f0f\u5806\u653e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u63a5\u89e6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u586b\u5145\u5bb9\u5668\u4e2d\u653e\u7f6e\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ed3\u5e93\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a5\u89e6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6253\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u6765\u521b\u9020\u53ef\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u653e\u7f6e\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u3002"}}

Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa3DGSNav\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D Gaussian Splatting\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u96f6-shot\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684ZSON\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684ZSON\u6846\u67b63DGSNav\uff0c\u5229\u75283D Gaussian Splatting\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89d2\u5207\u6362\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa3DGS\u8868\u793a\uff0c3DGSNav\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4e0eCoT\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "3DGSNav\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u4e14\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers.

We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $\u03c0_{0.5}$) by up to 21\\%, 48\\%, and 23\\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively.

While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AHAT\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u5bb6\u5ead\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u548cTGPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5927\u578b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8ba1\u5212\u957f\u5ea6\u53ca\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u7cca\u5ea6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u5feb\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Any House Any Task (AHAT)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528PDDL\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528TGPO\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "AHAT\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4e14\u6307\u4ee4\u7b80\u77ed\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "AHAT\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6307\u4ee4\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa CoVer \u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5 CoVer\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 SIMPLER \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f97\u5230 22% \u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe 45%\u3002\u5728 PolaRiS \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u5347 14%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528 CoVer \u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
