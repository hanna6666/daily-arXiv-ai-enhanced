A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution.

In this field test, Lidar Teach and Repeat provides an ideal autonomy solution for transporting cargo in this way. A one-tonne path-to-flight rover was driven in a semi-autonomous remote-control mode to create a network of safe paths. Once the route was taught, the rover immediately repeated the entire network of paths autonomously while carrying cargo. The closed-loop performance is accurate enough to align the vehicle to the cargo and pick it up.

Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u706b\u707e\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6FIRE-VLM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u706b\u707e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u706b\u707e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u706b\u707e\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u706b\u707e\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5229\u7528VLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PPO\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u6700\u591a6\u500d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u89c6\u573a\u5185\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76d1\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRE-VLM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u706b\u707e\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u706b\u707e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u706b\u707e\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6OFF-EMMA\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8d8a\u91ce\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528OFF-EMMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5757\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728RELLIS-3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOFF-EMMA\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747L2\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8613.3%\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u4ece16.52%\u964d\u4f4e\u52306.56%\u3002", "conclusion": "OFF-EMMA\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d8a\u91ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The WIM technique is a manipulation technique that uses miniatures, which has been proposed as a manipulation technique for virtual reality (VR). Our system uses the AR device's depth sensors to acquire a mesh of the room in real-time to create and update a miniature of a room in real-time. In our system, users can use miniature objects to move virtual objects to arbitrary positions and scale them to arbitrary sizes. In addition, because the miniature object can be manipulated instead of the real-scale object, we assumed that our system will shorten the placement time and reduce the workload of the user. In our previous study, we created a prototype and investigated the properties of manipulating miniature objects in AR. In this study, we conducted an experiment to evaluate how our system can support AR layout.

Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way.\n  We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance. Finally, we outline a residual reinforcement learning methodology to improve upon baseline robotic controls, highlighting future opportunities for improved string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684MIDI\u4e50\u8c31\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7fUR5e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5927\u63d0\u7434\u624b\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u822c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6f14\u594f\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u97f3\u4e50\u5bb6\u5728\u6f14\u594f\u5f26\u4e50\u5668\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u97f3\u7b26\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684MIDI\u4e50\u8c31\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u97f3\u4e50\u8f93\u5165\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e0e\u78b0\u649e-aware\u7684\u62c9\u5f13\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3aUR5e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u6f14\u594f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e132\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684Musical Turing Test\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5f55\u97f3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f26\u4e50\u4ea4\u53c9\u6548\u7387\u548c\u97f3\u8d28\u7684\u672a\u6765\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

GesFi first processes raw sensing data collected from WiFi receivers using CSI-ratio denoising, Short-Time Fast Fourier Transform, and visualization techniques to generate standardized input representations. It then employs class-wise adversarial learning to suppress gesture semantic and leverages unsupervised clustering to automatically uncover latent domain factors responsible for distributional shifts. These latent domains are then aligned through adversarial learning to support robust cross-domain generalization. Finally, the system is applied to the target environment for robust gesture inference. We deployed GesFi under both single-pair and multi-pair settings using commodity WiFi transceivers, and evaluated it across multiple public datasets and real-world environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, GesFi achieves up to 78% and 50% performance improvements over existing adversarial methods, and consistently outperforms prior generalization approaches across most cross-domain tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684WiFi\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edfGesFi\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7WiFi\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u6316\u6398\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "GesFi\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406WiFi\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u4f20\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CSI-ratio\u964d\u566a\u3001\u77ed\u65f6\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u6291\u5236\u624b\u52bf\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1f\u8d23\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "GesFi\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe78%\u548c50%\u3002", "conclusion": "GesFi\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u5bf9\u548c\u5355\u5bf9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8de8\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our approach addresses two key challenges: contact-rich motion planning and generalization across diverse terrains. To this end, we combine physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning. Keyframes encode human knowledge of motor skills, are embodiment-specific, and can be readily validated in simulation or on hardware, while reinforcement learning transforms these references into robust, physically accurate motions. We further employ a hierarchical framework consisting of terrain-specific motion-tracking policies, failure recovery mechanisms, and a vision-based skill planner.

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e16\u4ee3\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u6f14\u5316\u5f62\u6001\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u6f14\u5316\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e16\u4ee3\u66ff\u6362\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e16\u4ee3\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e16\u4ee3\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u6240\u7528\u7684\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u8981\u540c\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u5f62\u6001\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u7236\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ed9\u5b50\u4f53\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u5bf9\u7236\u4f53\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5b50\u4f53\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7ee7\u627f\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ee7\u627f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5355\u4e2a\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u9645\u7ee7\u627f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e16\u4ee3\u95f4\u79ef\u7d2f\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ee7\u627f\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing safeguarding concepts, such as Online Verification (OV), provide safety layers that detect infeasible planning outputs. However, they lack an active mechanism to ensure safe operation in the event that the main planner fails. This paper presents a first step toward an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving (AD). We deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on an automotive-grade, embedded platform running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The planner continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources, forming the foundation for future emergency planning architectures. Experimental results demonstrate deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating the feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware.

Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations.

However, they typically function as semantic reasoners, lacking an intrinsic understanding of the specific robot's physical capabilities. This limitation is particularly critical in interactive navigation, where robots must actively modify cluttered environments to create traversable paths. Existing VLM-based navigators are predominantly confined to passive obstacle avoidance, failing to reason about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths. To bridge this gap, we propose Counterfactual Interactive Navigation via Skill-aware VLM (CoINS), a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware reasoning and robust low-level execution. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM, named InterNav-VLM, which incorporates skill affordance and concrete constraint parameters into the input context and grounds them into a metric-scale environmental representation. By internalizing the logic of counterfactual reasoning through fine-tuning on the proposed InterNav dataset, the model learns to implicitly evaluate the causal effects of object removal on navigation connectivity, thereby determining interaction necessity and target selection. To execute the generated high-level plans, we develop a comprehensive skill library through reinforcement learning, specifically introducing traversability-oriented strategies to manipulate diverse objects for path clearance. A systematic benchmark in Isaac Sim is proposed to evaluate both the reasoning and execution aspects of interactive navigation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that CoINS significantly outperforms representative baselines, achieving a 17\\% higher overall success rate and over 80\\% improvement in complex long-horizon scenarios compared to the best-performing baseline", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoINS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoINS\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e92\u52a8\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aInterNav-VLM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CoINS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad817%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8fc780%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test", "comment": null, "summary": "As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86WoW-World-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f53\u73b0AI\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u76ee\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f53\u73b0\u5728AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b22\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WoW-World-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f53\u73b0AI\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9609\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4f53\u73b0\u5728AI\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate connected vehicles for emergency corridor formation. Our approach uses a high-level planner for global strategy and low-level controllers for trajectory execution, utilizing graph attention networks to scale with variable agent counts. Trained via Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), the system reduces emergency vehicle travel time by 28.3% compared to baselines and 44.6% compared to uncoordinated traffic in simulations. The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u534f\u8c03\u8054\u7f51\u8f66\u8f86\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u6025\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7d27\u6025\u8f66\u8f86\u901a\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u63d0\u9ad8\u7d27\u6025\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u62e5\u5835\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08MAPPO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7403\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6267\u884c\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7d27\u6025\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u901a\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8628.3%\uff0c\u4e0e\u65e0\u534f\u8c03\u4ea4\u901a\u76f8\u6bd4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8644.6%\uff1b\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff080.3%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630181%\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06GNN\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u53cc\u8f6e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e14\u5904\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u72ec\u7acb\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u53cc\u8f6e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u6d4b\u8ff7\u5bab\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4f7f\u7528AgentSpeak\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u5c0f\u578b\u53cc\u8f6e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7287\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u572859\u79d2\u5185\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ff7\u5bab\u3002"}}
