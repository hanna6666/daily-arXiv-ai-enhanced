In this paper, we explore designing AI systems that directly analyze humans' decision rationales and encourage critical reflection of their own decisions. We introduce the AI-Assisted Critical Thinking (AACT) framework, which leverages a domain-specific AI model's counterfactual analysis of human decision to help decision-makers identify potential flaws in their decision argument and support the correction of them. Through a case study on house price prediction, we find that AACT outperforms traditional AI-based decision-support in reducing over-reliance on AI, though also triggering higher cognitive load. Subgroup analysis reveals AACT can be particularly beneficial for some decision-makers such as those very familiar with AI technologies.

While children under 13 are protected by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), chatbot providers' own privacy policies may also provide protections, since they typically prohibit children from accessing their platforms. Age gating is often employed to restrict children online, but chatbot age gating in particular has not been studied. In this paper, we investigate whether popular consumer chatbots are (i) able to estimate users' ages based solely on their conversations, and (ii) whether they take action upon identifying children. To that end, we develop an auditing framework in which we programmatically interact with chatbots and conduct 1050 experiments using our comprehensive library of age-indicative prompts, including implicit and explicit age disclosures, to analyze the chatbots' responses and actions. We find that while chatbots are capable of estimating age, they do not take any action when children are identified, contradicting their own policies.

A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment.

The last two authors advised equally", "summary": "Robots operating in unstructured human environments inevitably encounter failures, especially in robot caregiving scenarios. While humans can often help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on the human partner. We present a human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies, where a policy is composed of distinct modules such as perception, planning, and control, any of which may fail and often require different forms of human feedback. Our framework integrates calibrated estimates of module-level uncertainty with models of human intervention cost to decide which module to query and when to query the human. It separates these two decisions: a module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure, and a querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously. We evaluate several module-selection strategies and querying algorithms in controlled synthetic experiments, revealing trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness to system and user variables, and user workload. Finally, we deploy the framework on a robot-assisted bite acquisition system and demonstrate, in studies involving individuals with both emulated and real mobility limitations, that it improves recovery success while reducing the workload imposed on users. Our results highlight how explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort can enable more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots.

The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing.

This extended study introduces a comprehensive, multimodal physiological framework for non-invasive hypoglycemia detection using wearable sensor signals. Unlike prior work limited to single-signal analysis, this chapter evaluates three physiological modalities, galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and their combined fusion, using the OhioT1DM 2018 dataset. We develop an end-to-end pipeline that integrates advanced preprocessing, temporal windowing, handcrafted and sequence-based feature extraction, early and late fusion strategies, and a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep temporal models, including CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and TCNs. Our results demonstrate that physiological signals exhibit distinct autonomic patterns preceding hypoglycemia and that combining GSR with HR consistently enhances detection sensitivity and stability compared to single-signal models. Multimodal deep learning architectures achieve the most reliable performance, particularly in recall, the most clinically urgent metric. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary contributions of each modality, strengthening the case for affordable, sensor-based glycemic monitoring. The findings show that real-time hypoglycemia detection is achievable using only inexpensive, non-invasive wearable sensors, offering a pathway toward accessible glucose monitoring in underserved communities and low-resource healthcare environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76ae\u80a4\u7535\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u5fc3\u7387\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8840\u7cd6\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08CGM\uff09\u6210\u672c\u6602\u8d35\u6216\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5730\u533a\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u9762\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u76ae\u80a4\u7535\u53cd\u5e94\u3001\u5fc3\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u878d\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u524d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76ae\u80a4\u7535\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7387\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e14\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u793e\u533a\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Yet, sensing muscle activation is barely explored in the rapidly growing mobile health market. Traditional methods for muscle activation sensing rely on specialized electrodes, such as surface electromyography, making them impractical, especially for long-term usage. In this paper, we introduce Press2Muscle, the first system to unobtrusively infer muscle activation using insole pressure sensors. The key idea is to analyze foot pressure changes resulting from full-body muscle activation that drives movements. To handle variations in pressure signals due to differences in users' gait, weight, and movement styles, we propose a data-driven approach to dynamically adjust reliance on different foot regions and incorporate easily accessible biographical data to enhance Press2Muscle's generalization to unseen users. We conducted an extensive study with 30 users. Under a leave-one-user-out setting, Press2Muscle achieves a root mean square error of 0.025, marking a 19% improvement over a video-based counterpart. A robustness study validates Press2Muscle's ability to generalize across user demographics, footwear types, and walking surfaces.

However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data.

Modern AI is transforming this process by enabling experts and non-experts alike to generate code without actually writing code, but instead, through natural language instructions, or \"vibe coding\". While increasingly popular, the cumulative impact of vibe coding on productivity and collaboration, as well as the role of humans in this process, remains unclear. Here, we introduce a controlled experimental framework for studying collaborative vibe coding and use it to compare human-led, AI-led, and hybrid groups. Across 16 experiments involving 604 human participants, we show that people provide uniquely effective high-level instructions for vibe coding across iterations, whereas AI-provided instructions often result in performance collapse.

To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time. Less informative sensors are down-sampled or deactivated, while critical sensors are sampled at higher fidelity as environmental conditions evolve.

Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0cLAP-3B\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u96f6-shot\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u4e0a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LAP\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "LAP-3B\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc750%\u7684\u96f6-shot\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8f83\u6700\u5f3a\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u53cc\u500d\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LAP-3B\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u96f6-shot\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios.

This study investigates how different VR input configurations - motion capture gloves, controllers with hand visualization, and controllers with controller visualization - affect user experience and task execution, with the goal of identifying which configuration is best suited for which type of task. Participants performed various kitchen-related activities of daily living (ADLs), including object placement, cutting, cleaning, and pouring in a simulated environment. To address two research questions, we evaluated user experience using the System Usability Scale and NASA Task Load Index (RQ1), and task-specific interaction behavior (RQ2). The latter was assessed using trajectory segmentation, analyzing movement efficiency, unnecessary actions, and execution precision. While no significant differences in overall usability and workload were found, trajectory analysis revealed configuration-specific execution behaviors with different movement strategies. Controllers enabled significantly faster task completion with less movement variability in pick-and-place style tasks such as table setting. In contrast, motion capture gloves produced more natural movements with fewer unnecessary actions, but also showed greater variance in movement patterns for manner-oriented tasks such as cutting bread.

Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks.

This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7684MPC\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u503e\u659c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u80f6\u56ca\u6eda\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4e0e\u80c3\u58c1\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u7ebf\u5708\u7535\u78c1\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u80f6\u56ca\u5185\u90e8\u6c38\u4e45\u78c1\u94c1\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u78c1\u529b\u548c\u626d\u77e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08MPC\uff09\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u5e8a\u771f\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u80c3\u9762\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u503e\u659c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u81f3\u4e94\u500d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u632f\u8361\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u503e\u659c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In safety-critical tasks, human oversight of these systems is required to mitigate risks and to ensure responsibility in case something goes wrong. Since people often struggle to stay focused and perform good oversight, intelligent support systems are used to assist them, giving decision recommendations, alerting users, or restricting them from dangerous actions. However, in cases where recommendations are wrong, decision support might undermine the very reason why human oversight was employed -- genuine moral responsibility. The goal of our study was to investigate how a decision support system that restricted available interventions would affect overseer's perceived moral responsibility, in particular in cases where the support errs. In a simulated oversight experiment, participants (\\textit{N}=274) monitored an autonomous drone that faced ten critical situations, choosing from six possible actions to resolve each situation. An AI system constrained participants' choices to either six, four, two, or only one option (between-subject study). Results showed that participants, who were restricted to choosing from a single action, felt less morally responsible if a crash occurred. At the same time, participants' judgments about the responsibility of other stakeholders (the AI; the developer of the AI) did not change between conditions. Our findings provide important insights for user interface design and oversight architectures: they should prevent users from attributing moral agency to AI, help them understand how moral responsibility is distributed, and, when oversight aims to prevent ethically undesirable outcomes, be designed to support the epistemic and causal conditions required for moral responsibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u9884\u9009\u9879\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u4ec5\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u9879\u884c\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u8003\u8651\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u627f\u62c5\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4ee5\u9632\u8303\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u627f\u62c5\u8d23\u4efb\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u5e72\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u51fa\u9519\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c274\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u76d1\u7763\u4e00\u67b6\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u5341\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4ece\u516d\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u6bcf\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\u522b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53ef\u9009\u884c\u52a8\u6570\u91cf\uff08\u516d\u3001\u56db\u3001\u4e8c\u6216\u4ec5\u4e00\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u53ea\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e00\u884c\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u82e5\u53d1\u751f\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u611f\u5230\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u5224\u65ad\u5219\u6ca1\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u53ea\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e00\u884c\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u53d1\u751f\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u611f\u5230\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u5bf9AI\u6216\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u6ca1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u67b6\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

Path analysis results indicate that the four Design Thinking Skills, Problem-driven Design (beta = 0.198, p < 0.01), Information-driven Design (beta = 0.241, p < 0.001), Solution-driven Design (beta = 0.227, p < 0.001), and Knowledge-driven Design (beta = 0.263, p < 0.001) all significantly and positively influence Design Thinking. Furthermore, Design Thinking has a significant positive predictive effect on Design Creativity & Innovation (beta = 0.286, p < 0.001). Mediation analysis confirms three significant mediation paths: the CSE mediation path (beta = 0.128, p < 0.001), the CCE mediation path (beta = 0.073, p < 0.01), and the \"CSE to CCE\" chain mediation path (beta = 0.025, p < 0.01).

Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u76843D\u6253\u5370\u8f6f\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u78c1\u6d82\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u94c1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u80f6\u56ca\u7684\u541e\u54bd\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u521b\u533b\u7597\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u94c1\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5360\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u76843D\u6253\u5370\u8f6f\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u6d82\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u94c1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u9759\u529b\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6eda\u52a8\u548c\u5168\u5411\u8f6c\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u578b\u6d82\u5c42\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5927\u5728\u5fae\u521b\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c113D\u70b9\u4e91\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Fitts\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u57283D\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5341\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528Fitts\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6a21\u62df\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u5957\u7d22\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7ed9\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline.

A basic demand-side question remains unanswered. When ordinary people can fact-check anything they want, what do they actually ask about? We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs.

Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u5e94\u5bf9\u5c4b\u9876\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u51fa\u8272\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c4b\u9876\u503e\u659c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6750\u6599\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u81c2\u65e0\u4eba\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c4b\u9876\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u91cf\u57fa\u7684\u626d\u77e9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u63a5\u89e6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u8fbe30.5\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5e73\u5747\u4e3a2.87\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u64cd\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5c4b\u9876\u7b49\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews with AV drivers analyzed using constructivist grounded theory, this study examines how users make sense of vehicular surveillance within everyday datafication. Findings reveal drivers demonstrate few AV-specific privacy concerns, instead normalizing monitoring through comparisons with established digital platforms. We theorize this indifference by situating AV surveillance within the `surveillance ecology' of platform environments, arguing the datafied car functions as a mobile extension of the `leaky home' -- private spaces rendered permeable through connected technologies continuously transmitting behavioral data.\n  The study contributes to scholarship on surveillance beliefs, datafication, and platform governance by demonstrating how users who have accepted comprehensive smartphone and smart home monitoring encounter AV datafication as just another node in normalized data extraction. We highlight how geographic restrictions on data access -- currently limiting driver log access to California -- create asymmetries that impede informed privacy deliberation, exemplifying `tertiary digital divides.' Finally, we examine how machine learning's reliance on data-intensive approaches creates structural pressure for surveillance that transcends individual manufacturer choices.

We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

This is the accepted author version", "summary": "AI technologies that sense student attention and emotions to enable more personalised teaching interventions are increasingly promoted, but raise pressing questions about student learning, well-being, and ethics. In particular, students' perspectives about AI sensing-intervention in learning are often overlooked. We conducted an online mixed-method experiment with Australian university students (N=132), presenting video scenarios varying by whether sensing was used (in-use vs. not-in-use), sensing modality (gaze-based attention detection vs. facial-based emotion detection), and intervention (by digital device vs. teacher). Participants also completed pairwise ranking tasks to prioritise six core ethical concerns. Findings revealed that students valued targeted intervention but responded negatively to AI monitoring, regardless of sensing methods.

Current $P^{-1}$ methods suffer from a fundamental limitation -- they can only generate a fixed surface-like structure in data space, which poorly covers the richness of this space. We address this by a new method that can `sweep' the data space under user control.

Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05).

Understanding the social context is crucial for robots to engage effectively, predict human intentions, and navigate interactions smoothly. This study aims to develop an empirical motion-time pattern for human gaze behavior in various social situations (e.g., entering, leaving, waving, talking, and pointing) using deep neural networks based on participants' data. We created two video clips-one for a computer screen and another for a virtual reality headset-depicting different social scenarios. Data were collected from 30 participants: 15 using an eye-tracker and 15 using an Oculus Quest 1 headset. Deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, were used to analyze and predict gaze patterns.

This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability.

Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture.

Schoellig"], "title": "SQ-CBF: Signed Distance Functions for Numerically Stable Superquadric-Based Safety Filtering", "comment": null, "summary": "Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks.

Marshall"], "title": "Digging for Data: Experiments in Rock Pile Characterization Using Only Proprioceptive Sensing in Excavation", "comment": "Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics", "summary": "Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry.

Our approach adds new capabilities to the state of the art, including the ability to reactively re-plan in response to new information, and planning contact locations and whole-body trajectories simultaneously, simplifying the implementation and removing the need for post-processing or complex multi-stage approaches. Our method is more resistant to local minima problems than other potential field based approaches, and our quadratic-program-based posture generator returns nodes more quickly than those of existing algorithms. Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u817f\u90e8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u518d\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u817f\u90e8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5730\u5e73\u7ebf\u591a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u63a5\u89e6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u518d\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u89c4\u5212\u5730\u5e73\u7ebf\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u89c4\u5212\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5730\u5e73\u7ebf\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u518d\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands.

We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD.
