Visual highlights can guide attention\neffectively but may also introduce unintended disruptions. To investigate this,\nwe examined how visual highlights affect users' gaze behavior in a drone\nmonitoring task, focusing on when, how long, and how much attention they draw.\nWe found that highlighted areas exhibit distinct temporal characteristics\ncompared to non-highlighted ones, quantified using normalized saliency (NS)\nmetrics. Highlights elicited immediate responses, with NS peaking quickly, but\nthis shift came at the cost of reduced search efforts elsewhere, potentially\nimpacting situational awareness. To predict these dynamic changes and support\ninterface design, we developed the Highlight-Informed Saliency Model (HISM),\nwhich provides granular predictions of NS over time.

This work\npresents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is\ncapable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts\nof both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained\npolicy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory\nevaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the\nperformance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.\nTo fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated\nand under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for\na given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for\ngeneralization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both\nthe policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and\nadditionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the\nsame task in a different one.

For example, a joystick can move a robotic\narm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional\nspace. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to\nsuboptimal performance of the learned policies.

This paper presents the industrial\nadoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally\nfor UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial\ninspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate\nchallenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by\nmanual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical\nweaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an\neffective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success\nrate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a\nsix-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary\nalgorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the\ndevelopment process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks,\nand strengthens the overall verification pipeline."}

Schoellig"], "title": "Failure Prediction at Runtime for Generative Robot Policies", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow\nmatching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,\ndistribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can\nstill cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early\nfailure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots\nin human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure\nprediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via\nconformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures\nfrom benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier\nthan existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards\nmore interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos\nare available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/fiper_website."}

Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance\nmaneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.\nAutomation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome\nthese challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular\nnavigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown\npromising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning\nframework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic\ncontrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire\nnavigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different\nmodular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under\nsimulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular\ngeometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the\naneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,\noutperforming several baselines.

Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses\ntopological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide\nbehaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns\nstate transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free\nEnergy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours.

Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a\nvirtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were\ncaptured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain\nwas paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440\nHz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional\n\"knocking\" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased\nsystematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only\ntrials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3,\nrespectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited\nstronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force\nneeded to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration.
