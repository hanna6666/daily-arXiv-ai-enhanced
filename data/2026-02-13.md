### [1] [Methodological Variation in Studying Staff and Student Perceptions of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11158)
*Juliana Gerard,Morgan Macleod,Kelly Norwood,Aisling Reid,Muskaan Singh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究比较了评估学生与员工对人工智能看法的不同方法，发现不同分析可能导致截然不同的结果，强调了在机构环境中理解这种变异的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨学生和员工对人工智能的看法在不同方法下的差异。

Method: 收集独立评论和结构化焦点小组的定性数据，进行情感和立场分析，以及词云和主题分析。

Result: 不同的方法产生不同的结果，显示出积极性/消极性的整体测量与内容细致分析之间的差异。

Conclusion: 不同分析方法可能导致不同的结果，尤其是在评估学生和员工对人工智能的看法时。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare methodological approaches for comparing student and staff perceptions, and ask: how much do these measures vary across different approaches? We focus on the case of AI perceptions, which are generally assessed via a single quantitative or qualitative measure, or with a mixed methods approach that compares two distinct data sources - e.g. a quantitative questionnaire with qualitative comments. To compare different approaches, we collect two forms of qualitative data: standalone comments and structured focus groups. We conduct two analyses for each data source: with a sentiment and stance analysis, we measure overall negativity/positivity of the comments and focus group conversations, respectively. Meanwhile, word clouds from the comments and a thematic analysis of the focus groups provide further detail on the content of this qualitative data - particularly the thematic analysis, which includes both similarities and differences between students and staff. We show that different analyses can produce different results - for a single data source. This variation stems from the construct being evaluated - an overall measure of positivity/negativity can produce a different picture from more detailed content-based analyses. We discuss the implications of this variation for institutional contexts, and for the comparisons from previous studies.

### [2] [BIRD: A Museum Open Dataset Combining Behavior Patterns and Identity Types to Better Model Visitors' Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11160)
*Alexanne Worm,Florian Marchal,Sylvain Castagnos*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究了文化遗产领域数据稀缺的问题，通过对访客的数据收集与分析，构建了一个综合性的开放数据集，用于提升博物馆的个性化推荐和访问体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文化遗产领域数据稀缺的问题，以便更全面地建模游客的体验。

Method: 通过眼动追踪眼镜收集游客在博物馆的浏览数据，结合人口统计、偏好、访问习惯和反馈等多种数据，开展研究。

Result: 建立了一个综合性的开放数据集，能够重现文献中的游客身份特征，并改善博物馆的个性化推荐。

Conclusion: 通过构建一个开放的数据集，我们能够改善博物馆推荐路径的质量，并根据游客的兴趣水平个性化提供信息。

Abstract: Lack of data is a recurring problem in Artificial Intelligence, as it is essential for training and validating models. This is particularly true in the field of cultural heritage, where the number of open datasets is relatively limited and where the data collected does not always allow for holistic modeling of visitors' experience due to the fact that data are ad hoc (i.e. restricted to the sole characteristics required for the evaluation of a specific model). To overcome this lack, we conducted a study between February and March 2019 aimed at obtaining comprehensive and detailed information about visitors, their visit experience and their feedback. We equipped 51 participants with eye-tracking glasses, leaving them free to explore the 3 floors of the museum for an average of 57 minutes, and to discover an exhibition of more than 400 artworks. On this basis, we built an open dataset combining contextual data (demographic data, preferences, visiting habits, motivations, social context. . . ), behavioral data (spatiotemporal trajectories, gaze data) and feedback (satisfaction, fatigue, liked artworks, verbatim. . . ). Our analysis made it possible to re-enact visitor identities combining the majority of characteristics found in the literature and to reproduce the Veron and Levasseur profiles. This dataset will ultimately make it possible to improve the quality of recommended paths in museums by personalizing the number of points of interest (POIs), the time spent at these different POIs, and the amount of information to be provided to each visitor based on their level of interest.

### [3] [Althea: Human-AI Collaboration for Fact-Checking and Critical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11161)
*Svetlana Churina,Kokil Jaidka,Anab Maulana Barik,Harshit Aneja,Cai Yang,Wynne Hsu,Mong Li Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Althea是一个可扩展的事实验证系统，通过有效的用户交互模式提升用户对在线声明的评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对网络信息生态系统需要可扩展且可信的事实验证系统。

Method: 引入Althea，一个集成了问题生成、证据检索和结构化推理的检索增强系统。

Result: 在AVeriTeC基准上，Althea的Macro-F1达到0.44，超越了标准验证管道，并改善了对支持和反驳声明的区分能力。

Conclusion: Althea系统通过不同的互动模式支持用户对在线声明进行评估，显示出灵活的性能提升与用户信心的增强。

Abstract: The web's information ecosystem demands fact-checking systems that are both scalable and epistemically trustworthy. Automated approaches offer efficiency but often lack transparency, while human verification remains slow and inconsistent. We introduce Althea, a retrieval-augmented system that integrates question generation, evidence retrieval, and structured reasoning to support user-driven evaluation of online claims. On the AVeriTeC benchmark, Althea achieves a Macro-F1 of 0.44, outperforming standard verification pipelines and improving discrimination between supported and refuted claims. We further evaluate Althea through a controlled user study and a longitudinal survey experiment (N = 642), comparing three interaction modes that vary in the degree of scaffolding: an Exploratory mode with guided reasoning, a Summary mode providing synthesized verdicts, and a Self-search mode that offers procedural guidance without algorithmic intervention. Results show that guided interaction produces the strongest immediate gains in accuracy and confidence, while self-directed search yields the most persistent improvements over time. This pattern suggests that performance gains are not driven solely by effort or exposure, but by how cognitive work is structured and internalized.

Conclusion: DiSCoKit 是一个开源工具包，旨在克服在在线调查中使用大型语言模型的技术和实践挑战，从而推动人机交互的社会科学研究。

Abstract: Advancing social-scientific research of human-AI interaction dynamics and outcomes often requires researchers to deliver experiences with live large-language models (LLMs) to participants through online survey platforms. However, technical and practical challenges (from logging chat data to manipulating AI behaviors for experimental designs) often inhibit survey-based deployment of AI stimuli. We developed DiSCoKit--an open-source toolkit for deploying live LLM experiences (e.g., ones based on models delivered through Microsoft Azure portal) through JavaScript-enabled survey platforms (e.g., Qualtrics). This paper introduces that toolkit, explaining its scientific impetus, describes its architecture and operation, as well as its deployment possibilities and limitations.

### [5] [Same Feedback, Different Source: How AI vs. Human Feedback Shapes Learner Engagement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11311)
*Caitlin Morris,Pattie Maes*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 学习者对反馈来源的归因会影响他们的参与度和评估，特别是在AI与人类助教的混合教学环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伴随AI的使用，了解反馈来源的归因效应对于设计有效的混合教育系统至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个创意编码界面，隔离源归因，同时控制内容，把参与者分为看到AI反馈和人类助教反馈的两个组。

Result: 发现参与者在接受人类助教反馈时花费的时间和精力显著更多，反馈评估受到对不同反馈来源的信任和真实感的影响。

Conclusion: 反馈来源影响学习者的参与度和评估，提示在设计混合教育系统时需考虑来源归因效应。

Abstract: When learners receive feedback, what they believe about its source may shape how they engage with it. As AI is used alongside human instructors, understanding these attribution effects is essential for designing effective hybrid AI-human educational systems. We designed a creative coding interface that isolates source attribution while controlling for content: all participants receive identical LLM-generated feedback, but half see it attributed to AI and half to a human teaching assistant (TA). We found two key results. First, perceived feedback source affected engagement: learners in the TA condition spent significantly more time and effort (d = 0.88-1.56) despite receiving identical feedback. Second, perceptions differed: AI-attributed feedback ratings were predicted by prior trust in AI (r = 0.85), while TA-attributed ratings were predicted by perceived genuineness (r = 0.65). These findings suggest that feedback source shapes both engagement and evaluation, with implications for hybrid educational system design.

### [6] [Situated, Dynamic, and Subjective: Envisioning the Design of Theory-of-Mind-Enabled Everyday AI with Industry Practitioners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11342)
*Qiaosi Wang,Jini Kim,Avanita Sharma,Alicia,Lee,Jodi Forlizzi,Hong Shen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了ToM能力在AI产品中的应用，提出了三项设计建议，并强调了与现实实践之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ToM能力被认为是人类社会交往的基础，但其在日常用户面对的AI产品设计中的应用尚不明确。

Method: 通过与26位美国AI从业者进行13个共同设计会议，提出并精炼了ToM-enabled AI产品和服务的设计建议。

Result: 分析揭示了三个相互关联的设计建议，并指出从业者对ToM-enabled AI的未来愿景与现实之间存在更广泛的差距。

Conclusion: 研究表明，ToM-enabled AI需要超越静态推理驱动的方法，而是设计为一种支持持续人机交互循环的普遍能力。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) -- the ability to infer what others are thinking (e.g., intentions) from observable cues -- is traditionally considered fundamental to human social interactions. This has sparked growing efforts in building and benchmarking AI's ToM capability, yet little is known about how such capability could translate into the design and experience of everyday user-facing AI products and services. We conducted 13 co-design sessions with 26 U.S.-based AI practitioners to envision, reflect, and distill design recommendations for ToM-enabled everyday AI products and services that are both future-looking and grounded in the realities of AI design and development practices. Analysis revealed three interrelated design recommendations: ToM-enabled AI should 1) be situated in the social context that shape users' mental states, 2) be responsive to the dynamic nature of mental states, and 3) be attuned to subjective individual differences. We surface design tensions within each recommendation that reveal a broader gap between practitioners' envisioned futures of ToM-enabled AI and the realities of current AI design and development practices. These findings point toward the need to move beyond static, inference-driven approach to ToM and toward designing ToM as a pervasive capability that supports continuous human-AI interaction loops.

### [7] [Interpretive Cultures: Resonance, randomness, and negotiated meaning for AI-assisted tarot divination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11367)
*Matthew Prock,Ziv Epstein,Hope Schroeder,Amy Smith,Cassandra Lee,Vana Goblot,Farnaz Jahanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI辅助塔罗牌解读的实践，发现用户如何在解读过程中整合AI，以支持主观和多元的意义产生，同时提出设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成性AI工具在创造性和分析性任务中逐渐被采用，但其在主观、多元及非因果的解读实践中的作用仍不明确。

Method: 通过对塔罗牌实践者的访谈，结合哈特穆特·罗莎的共鸣理论，探讨用户如何寻求、协商和评估共鸣解读。

Result: 研究发现，从业者在解读工作流中以不同方式整合AI，使用AI来应对不确定性、自我怀疑，探索替代观点，以及简化或扩展现有的占卜实践。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了设计建议，以便开发能够支持解读意义生成的AI系统，同时不消解模糊性或限制用户的主动性。

Abstract: While generative AI tools are increasingly adopted for creative and analytical tasks, their role in interpretive practices, where meaning is subjective, plural, and non-causal, remains poorly understood. This paper examines AI-assisted tarot reading, a divinatory practice in which users pose a query, draw cards through a randomized process, and ask AI systems to interpret the resulting symbols. Drawing on interviews with tarot practitioners and Hartmut Rosa's Theory of Resonance, we investigate how users seek, negotiate, and evaluate resonant interpretations in a context where no causal relationship exists between the query and the data being interpreted. We identify distinct ways practitioners incorporate AI into their interpretive workflows, including using AI to navigate uncertainty and self-doubt, explore alternative perspectives, and streamline or extend existing divinatory practices. Based on these findings, we offer design recommendations for AI systems that support interpretive meaning-making without collapsing ambiguity or foreclosing user agency.

### [8] [Understanding Persuasive Interactions between Generative Social Agents and Humans: The Knowledge-based Persuasion Model (KPM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11483)
*Stephan Vonschallen,Friederike Eyssel,Theresa Schmiedel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出知识驱动说服模型(KPM)，为研究生成社交代理(GSAs)的用户互动提供理论框架，强调应遵循社会规范和伦理标准，提高用户福祉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于目前对GSAs互动的理论探讨不足，缺乏研究其对用户态度和行为影响的指导，提出KPM作为新的理论框架。

Method: 提出知识驱动说服模型(KPM)，阐述GSAs的自我、用户和情境相关知识如何影响其说服行为及人类用户的态度和行为。

Result: 通过整合现有研究，KPM为研究GSAs的互动关系提供了结构化的方法，旨在促使GSAs激励而非操控用户。

Conclusion: KPM为研究与GSAs的互动提供了理论框架，强调负责任的智能体设计，以提高用户福祉。

Abstract: Generative social agents (GSAs) use artificial intelligence to autonomously communicate with human users in a natural and adaptive manner. Currently, there is a lack of theorizing regarding interactions with GSAs, and likewise, few guidelines exist for studying how they influence user attitudes and behaviors. Consequently, we propose the Knowledge-based Persuasion Model (KPM) as a novel theoretical framework. According to the KPM, a GSA's self, user, and context-related knowledge drives its persuasive behavior, which in turn shapes the attitudes and behaviors of a responding human user. By synthesizing existing research, the model offers a structured approach to studying interactions with GSAs, supporting the development of agents that motivate rather than manipulate humans. Accordingly, the KPM encourages the integration of responsible GSAs that adhere to social norms and ethical standards with the goal of increasing user wellbeing. Implications of the KPM for research and application domains such as healthcare and education are discussed.

### [9] [Data-driven modelling of low-dimensional dynamical structures underlying complex full-body human movement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11492)
*Ryota Takamido,Chiharu Suzuki,Hiroki Nakamoto*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究使用神经常微分方程模型复杂的人类全身运动，特别是棒球投球，表明能够扩展动力系统方法以适应更复杂的运动形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类运动控制和学习中的自由度问题，特别是动力系统方法的应用仅限于周期性或简化运动。

Method: 使用神经常微分方程（NODEs）创建一个低维潜在动力系统来模拟非周期性全身运动的时间演变。

Result: 棒球投球的复杂运动可以准确预测，后半部分运动约50%的方差仅通过初始8%的时间序列进行解释。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，使用NODEs可以扩展动力系统方法（DSA）以处理更复杂的人类运动，尤其是全身运动如棒球投球。

Abstract: One of the central challenges in the study of human motor control and learning is the degrees-of-freedom problem. Although the dynamical systems approach (DSA) has provided valuable insights into addressing this issue, its application has largely been confined to cyclic or simplified motor movements. To overcome this limitation, the present study employs neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) to model the time evolution of non-cyclic full-body movements as a low-dimensional latent dynamical system. Given the temporal complexity full-body kinematic chains, baseball pitching was selected as a representative target movement to examine whether DSA could be extended to more complex, ecologically valid human movements. Results of the verification experiment demonstrated that the time evolution of a complex pitching motion could be accurately predicted (R^2 > 0.45) using the NODE-based dynamical model. Notably, approximately 50% of the variance in the latter half of the pitching motion was explained using only the initial ~8% of the temporal sequence, underscoring how subsequent movement evolves from initial conditions according to ODE-defined dynamics in latent space. These findings indicate the potential to extend the DSA to more complex and ecologically valid forms of human movement.

*Ryuji Matsuo,Hailong Liu,Toshihiro Hiraoka,Takahiro Wada*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于语音的HMI，该方法有效提升驾驶员对高等级自动驾驶系统（ADS）限制造及的理解，促进安全接管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂交通情况下，驾驶员对RtI的触发信号有多重感知，从而导致犹豫或困惑，驾驶员需要明确理解ADS的系统限制以保证安全接管。

Method: 通过一个驾驶模拟器进行组间实验，以测试基于语音的教育人机界面（HMI）。

Result: 实验结果表明，添加有效的触发信号和理由的RtI可以改善驾驶员对ADS系统限制的理解，参与者的碰撞率较低。

Conclusion: 使用提议的方法可以持续增强驾驶员对ADS系统限制的理解，从而与ADS进行更安全有效的实时交互。

Abstract: Level 3 automated driving systems (ADS) have attracted significant attention and are being commercialized. A level 3 ADS prompts the driver to take control by issuing a request to intervene (RtI) when its operational design domains (ODD) are exceeded. However, complex traffic situations can cause drivers to perceive multiple potential triggers of RtI simultaneously, causing hesitation or confusion during take-over. Therefore, drivers need to clearly understand the ADS's system limitations to ensure safe take-over. This study proposes a voice-based educational human machine interface~(HMI) for providing RtI trigger cues and reason to help drivers understand ADS's system limitations. The results of a between-group experiment using a driving simulator showed that incorporating effective trigger cues and reason into the RtI was related to improved driver comprehension of the ADS's system limitations. Moreover, most participants, instructed via the proposed method, could proactively take over control of the ADS in cases where RtI fails; meanwhile, their number of collisions was lower compared with the other RtI HMI conditions. Therefore, using the proposed method to continually enhance the driver's understanding of the system limitations of ADS through the proposed method is associated with safer and more effective real-time interactions with ADS.

*Dennis Kim,Roya Daneshi,Bruce Draper,Sarath Sreedharan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 随着AI工具在各领域的应用，用户对人类专家和AI的信任受到AI参与方式的影响，设计人类-AI混合团队时需考虑这一点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI工具的整合如何影响用户对人类专家及AI系统的信任。

Method: 进行了一个用户研究(N=77)，通过模拟课程规划任务比较不同的AI干预条件和人类-AI合作方式。

Result: 虽然顾问创建正确日程的能力重要，但用户对专家的专业性和信任也受到专家利用AI助手方式的影响。

Conclusion: 人工智能的参与影响用户对人类专家、AI系统及其组合的信任，而用户对专家运用AI助手的方式也影响其对专家的专业性和信任感。

Abstract: The increasing integration of AI-powered tools into expert workflows, such as medicine, law, and finance, raises a critical question: how does AI involvement influence a user's trust in the human expert, the AI system, and their combination? To investigate this, we conducted a user study (N=77) featuring a simulated course-planning task. We compared various conditions that differed in both the presence of AI and the specific mode of human-AI collaboration. Our results indicate that while the advisor's ability to create a correct schedule is important, the user's perception of expertise and trust is also influenced by how the expert utilized the AI assistant. These findings raise important considerations for the design of human-AI hybrid teams, particularly when the adoption of recommendations depends on the end-user's perception of the recommender's expertise.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究了用户在与大语言模型交互中的过度依赖行为，识别出与这一现象相关的五种用户行为模式，并提出设计上的改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在日常场景中的广泛应用，用户对其过度依赖可能导致错误信息的传播，因此有必要研究用户行为模式与过度依赖之间的关联。

Method: 通过收集77名参与者在使用大语言模型（LLM）时的互动日志，评估他们是否能发现和纠正嵌入的虚假信息，以此来评估过度依赖现象。

Result: 通过语义编码和聚类用户互动片段，研究识别出低过度依赖与高过度依赖用户的五种行为模式，从而提供设计启示以减轻此类问题。

Conclusion: 本文识别了与过度依赖人工智能相关的五种用户行为模式，并讨论了减轻这些影响的设计启示。

Abstract: LLMs are now embedded in a wide range of everyday scenarios. However, their inherent hallucinations risk hiding misinformation in fluent responses, raising concerns about overreliance on AI. Detecting overreliance is challenging, as it often arises in complex, dynamic contexts and cannot be easily captured by post-hoc task outcomes. In this work, we aim to investigate how users' behavioral patterns correlate with overreliance. We collected interaction logs from 77 participants working with an LLM injected plausible misinformation across three real-world tasks and we assessed overreliance by whether participants detected and corrected these errors. By semantically encoding and clustering segments of user interactions, we identified five behavioral patterns linked to overreliance: users with low overreliance show careful task comprehension and fine-grained navigation; users with high overreliance show frequent copy-paste, skipping initial comprehension, repeated LLM references, coarse locating, and accepting misinformation despite hesitation. We discuss design implications for mitigation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究分析了TikTok上关于近乎死亡经验的叙述，显示这些叙述如何在在线平台上促进灵性主题的讨论和个人与社区的连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究近乎死亡事件（NDE）叙述在社交媒体上传达的方式，以深度理解个人如何处理创伤和表达信仰。

Method: 内容分析200个随机采样的TikTok视频，标签为#nde及相关标签。

Result: 发现NDE叙述用于表达人生意义，灵性和宗教主题占大多数，吸引更多互动并引发深刻的信仰和意义讨论。

Conclusion: 社交媒体平台促进了对灵性社区的群体参与，揭示了共享表达和连接空间设计的潜在影响。

Abstract: People who experienced near-death events often turn to personal expression as a way of processing trauma and articulating beliefs. While scholars have examined how individuals share near-death experiences (NDEs), limited research has explored how these narratives are communicated collaboratively on today's social media platforms. We analyzed 200 randomly sampled TikTok videos tagged with #nde and related hashtags. Content analysis revealed that individuals often use NDE narratives to articulate personal meaning, with spiritual and religious themes appearing in the majority of posts and serving as a means of exploring and making sense of personal spiritual perspectives. Consistent with this, analyses of comment sections reveal that videos containing spiritual themes tend to attract more engagement and foster deeper conversations around faith and meaning. Our findings offer insights into how online platforms facilitate community-level engagement with spirituality, and suggest implications for design of spaces that support shared expression and connection in specialized communities.

Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of affective extended reality (XR) to characterise XR systems that use biodata to enable understanding of emotions. The HCI literature contains many such systems, but they have not yet been mapped into a coherent whole. To address this, we conducted a scoping review of 82 papers that explore the nexus of biodata, emotions, and XR. We analyse the technologies used in these systems, the interaction techniques employed, and the methods used to evaluate their effectiveness. Through our analysis, we contribute a mapping of the current landscape of affective XR, revealing diversity in the goals for enabling emotion sharing. We demonstrate how HCI researchers have explored the design of the interaction flows in XR biofeedback systems, highlighting key design dimensions and challenges in understanding emotions. We discuss underused approaches for emotion sharing and highlight opportunities for future research on affective XR.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values fundamentally relies on effective human feedback. While significant research has addressed training algorithms, the role of user interface is often overlooked and only treated as an implementation detail rather than a critical factor of alignment. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a reference model that offers a systematic framework for analyzing where and how user interface contributions can improve human-AI alignment. The structured taxonomy of the reference model is demonstrated through two case studies and a preliminary investigation featuring six user interfaces. This work highlights opportunities to advance alignment through human-computer interaction.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种决策支持框架，通过结合技术可行性和人类基本价值，促进以价值为中心的技术机会发现，强调了在早期研发决策中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现技术机会（TOD）在创新管理中仍然是一个关键挑战，尤其在早期开发阶段，消费者需求往往不明确。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的决策支持框架，将技术可行性与基本人类价值观相连接，并结合了工程基础的技术成熟度等级（TRL）和施瓦茨基本人类价值理论。

Result: 通过与消费者和内部专家进行探索性研讨，分析了四种真实世界技术的案例，揭示了成功技术与消费者之间的价值差异，从而建议市场成功取决于战略前瞻性。

Conclusion: 本研究为早期研发决策提供了实用工具，并建立了价值理论与创新成果之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Discovering technology opportunities (TOD) remains a critical challenge for innovation management, especially in early-stage development where consumer needs are often unclear. Existing methods frequently fail to systematically incorporate end-user perspectives, resulting in a misalignment between technological potentials and market relevance. This study proposes a novel decision support framework that bridges this gap by linking technological feasibility with fundamental human values. The framework integrates two distinct lenses: the engineering-based Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Schwartz's theory of basic human values. By combining these, the approach enables a structured exploration of how emerging technologies may satisfy diverse user motivations. To illustrate the framework's feasibility and insight potential, we conducted exploratory workshops with general consumers and internal experts at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc., analyzing four real-world technologies (two commercial successes and two failures). Two consistent patterns emerged: (1) internal experts identified a wider value landscape than consumers (vision gap), and (2) successful technologies exhibited a broader range of associated human values (value breadth), suggesting strategic foresight may underpin market success. This study contributes both a practical tool for early-stage R\&D decision-making and a theoretical link between value theory and innovation outcomes. While exploratory in scope, the findings highlight the promise of value-centric evaluation as a foundation for more human-centered technology opportunity discovery.

TL;DR: 本文提出人类-LLM原型的概念，并通过文献回顾和案例分析，探讨人类与LLM在决策过程中的互动模式及其对决策输出的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险领域的决策支持作用日益增强，对人类与LLMs在决策中的角色及相互作用方式的社会技术因素进行反思显得尤为重要。

Method: 通过对113篇支持LLM决策的文献进行范围性文献回顾和主题分析，识别出17种人类-LLM原型，并在实际临床诊断案例中评估这些原型的效果。

Result: 识别出17种不同的人类-LLM原型，并探讨它们在实际应用中的潜在影响。

Conclusion: 选择人类-LLM交互原型会影响LLM输出和决策，给人机决策系统的设计者带来重要风险和考量。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly supporting decision-making across high-stakes domains, requiring critical reflection on the socio-technical factors that shape how humans and LLMs are assigned roles and interact during human-in-the-loop decision-making. This paper introduces the concept of human-LLM archetypes -- defined as re-curring socio-technical interaction patterns that structure the roles of humans and LLMs in collaborative decision-making. We describe 17 human-LLM archetypes derived from a scoping literature review and thematic analysis of 113 LLM-supported decision-making papers. Then, we evaluate these diverse archetypes across real-world clinical diagnostic cases to examine the potential effects of adopting distinct human-LLM archetypes on LLM outputs and decision outcomes. Finally, we present relevant tradeoffs and design choices across human-LLM archetypes, including decision control, social hierarchies, cognitive forcing strategies, and information requirements. Through our analysis, we show that selection of human-LLM interaction archetype can influence LLM outputs and decisions, bringing important risks and considerations for the designers of human-AI decision-making systems

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了USE24-XD数据集，通过大型语言模型标注选举期间的社交媒体帖子，支持反对选举错误信息的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和缓解选举中的有害内容传播，以保护民主的完整性。

Method: 采用六种大型语言模型(LM)对近10万条社交媒体帖子进行标注，分为五个类别，并通过众包验证结果。

Result: LLMs的标注与人工标注者一致，DL模型在标注的一致性与召回率方面表现优越，同时揭示了人类标注者的主体性影响。

Conclusion: USE24-XD数据集的发布将支持未来关于选举错误信息和有害政治内容的研究。

Abstract: The spread of election misinformation and harmful political content conveys misleading narratives and poses a serious threat to democratic integrity. Detecting harmful content at early stages is essential for understanding and potentially mitigating its downstream spread. In this study, we introduce USE24-XD, a large-scale dataset of nearly 100k posts collected from X (formerly Twitter) during the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle, enriched with spatio-temporal metadata. To substantially reduce the cost of manual annotation while enabling scalable categorization, we employ six large language models (LLMs) to systematically annotate posts across five nuanced categories: Conspiracy, Sensationalism, Hate Speech, Speculation, and Satire. We validate LLM annotations with crowdsourcing (n = 34) and benchmark them against human annotators. Inter-rater reliability analyses show comparable agreement patterns between LLMs and humans, with LLMs exhibiting higher internal consistency and achieving up to 0.90 recall on Speculation. We apply a wisdom-of-the-crowd approach across LLMs to aggregate annotations and curate a robust multi-label dataset. 60% of posts receive at least one label. We further analyze how human annotator demographics, including political ideology and affiliation, shape labeling behavior, highlighting systematic sources of subjectivity in judgments of harmful content. The USE24-XD dataset is publicly released to support future research.

Motivation: 蓝领工作的协作性和具身性特点尚未在AI研究中得到充分关注，现有研究多集中于白领工作，因此需要探索具身AI在蓝领工作中的应用。

Method: 讨论两种来自工业和维护场景的推测性情境，探讨具身AI代理如何支持团队协作及沟通。

Result: 本文提出了关于具身AI设计的开放性问题，强调包容性、代理性和蓝领合作实践时间演变的重要性，并认为具身性应成为设计AI系统的关键策略。

Conclusion: 通过强调AI的具身性，这项研究呼吁在蓝领工作环境中重新思考AI系统的设计，以促进员工间的包容性和协作。

Abstract: Blue-collar work is often highly collaborative, embodied, and situated in shared physical environments, yet most research on collaborative AI has focused on white-collar work. This position paper explores how the embodied nature of AI agents can support team collaboration and communication in co-located blue-collar workplaces. From the context of our newly started CAI-BLUE research project, we present two speculative scenarios from industrial and maintenance contexts that illustrate how embodied AI agents can support shared situational awareness and facilitate inclusive communication across experience levels. We outline open questions related to embodied AI agent design around worker inclusion, agency, transformation of blue-collar collaboration practices over time, and forms of acceptable AI embodiments. We argue that embodiment is not just an aesthetic choice but should become a socio-material design strategy of AI systems in blue-collar workplaces.

Abstract: Digital platforms shape how people communicate, deliberate, and form opinions. Studying these dynamics has become increasingly difficult due to restricted data access, ethical constraints on real-world experiments, and limitations of existing research tools. VIRENA (Virtual Arena) is a platform that enables controlled experimentation in realistic social media environments. Multiple participants interact simultaneously in realistic replicas of feed-based platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Reddit) and messaging apps (WhatsApp, Messenger). Large language model-powered AI agents participate alongside humans with configurable personas and realistic behavior. Researchers can manipulate content moderation approaches, pre-schedule stimulus content, and run experiments across conditions through a visual interface requiring no programming skills. VIRENA makes possible research designs that were previously impractical: studying human--AI interaction in realistic social contexts, experimentally comparing moderation interventions, and observing group deliberation as it unfolds. Built on open-source technologies that ensure data remain under institutional control and comply with data protection requirements, VIRENA is currently in use at the University of Zurich and available for pilot collaborations. Designed for researchers, educators, and public organizations alike, VIRENA's no-code interface makes controlled social media simulation accessible across disciplines and sectors. This paper documents its design, architecture, and capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言导航模型存在位置误差累积的问题，导致内部信念与真实坐标的不一致，影响了完整轨迹预测的准确性。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架NeuroKalman，将导航过程分为先验预测和根据历史观察进行的似然校正，并结合了核密度估计与基于注意力的检索机制。

Result: 在TravelUAV基准测试中的实验表明，仅通过对10%的训练数据进行微调，NeuroKalman方法显著优于强基线，并有效规制漂移累积。

Conclusion: NeuroKalman方法通过引入先验预测和似然校正，显著改善了无人机在复杂环境中的导航性能，减少了状态漂移的积累，超越了现有强基线模型。

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的任务和运动规划依赖于符号逻辑世界模型，但与视觉感知独立操作，阻碍了符号和感知状态的同步预测。

Method: 提出了一种分层世界模型（H-WM），将高层逻辑世界模型与低层视觉世界模型相结合，进行逻辑和视觉状态转换的联合预测。

Result: 通过视觉-语言-动作（VLA）控制政策的实验，验证了该方法的有效性和普适性。

Conclusion: 提出的H-WM模型通过联合预测逻辑和视觉状态转变，提供了稳定一致的中间指导，有效减少了错误积累，提高了长时间任务的执行能力。

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

Method: 提出了一种低延迟的全身控制框架ExtremControl，直接运用选定刚体链的SE(3)姿态，使用笛卡尔空间映射转换人类运动为人形链目标，并在低级别中整合速度前馈控制。

Result: 实现了低至50ms的端到端延迟，并支持光学运动捕捉和基于虚拟现实的运动跟踪，能够执行快速反馈任务，如乒乓球平衡和杂耍。

Conclusion: ExtremControl显著降低了 humanoid 远程操作系统的延迟，实现了高响应性行为，超越了先前工作的延迟限制。

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

Motivation: 现有传统方法在从视频学习时存在局限，难以有效衡量视觉状态的长期价值并在不同环境中传递学习成果。

Method: 通过学习预测跟踪点在后续图像间的运动来建模人类偏好，定义奖励函数为机器人行为中预测与观察到的物体运动的一致性，并使用修改后的Soft Actor Critic算法来估计价值函数并优化策略。

Result: 我们的模型在多个任务中的表现与先前的研究相匹配或更优，既在模拟环境中也在真实机器人上均得到了验证。

Conclusion: 我们的算法在多个任务中表现优异，能够在真实机器人上学习并优化策略。

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

Motivation: 收集大规模真实世界数据的高成本阻碍了机器人模仿学习，特别是针对低成本家庭使用的用户友好型机器人。

Result: 在低成本LeRobot平台上的实验表明，EasyMimic在各种操作任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: EasyMimic为低成本家庭机器人提供了一种有效的模仿学习方法，显著降低了对昂贵数据采集的依赖。

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

Motivation: 传统的移动机器人任务规划往往假设完全环境知识，而在任务关键目标未知时无法进行有效规划。

Method: 开发了一种基于模型的LIOS动作的任务规划框架，其中LIOS动作被视为确定性策略，生成交错搜索和执行的计划。

Result: 在模拟的ProcTHOR家庭和现实世界中，我们的方法在检索和餐饮准备等任务中表现优于非学习和学习基线。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在不确定性情况下进行有效的任务规划，并在检索和餐饮准备等任务中优于其他基线。

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管4D毫米波雷达在成本和天气鲁棒性方面具有优势，但其在3D目标检测上的表现仍不及LiDAR，本文旨在改善这一局面。

Method: HyperDet框架通过聚合多个4D毫米波雷达的返回数据，结合几何一致性验证和扩散模块，提升雷达点云的密度和覆盖率。

Result: HyperDet在MAN TruckScenes数据集上表现优于原始雷达输入，并成功缩小了雷达与LiDAR的性能差距。

Conclusion: HyperDet能有效提升雷达数据的利用率，使其在标准LiDAR检测器中表现更佳，并且在一定程度上缩小了雷达与LiDAR之间的差距。

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go显著提高了在模拟和真实世界环境中导航性能，展示了其在未知环境的零-shot转移能力。

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

Abstract: Embodied navigation has long been fragmented by task-specific architectures. We introduce ABot-N0, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model that achieves a ``Grand Unification'' across 5 core tasks: Point-Goal, Object-Goal, Instruction-Following, POI-Goal, and Person-Following. ABot-N0 utilizes a hierarchical ``Brain-Action'' architecture, pairing an LLM-based Cognitive Brain for semantic reasoning with a Flow Matching-based Action Expert for precise, continuous trajectory generation.
  To support large-scale learning, we developed the ABot-N0 Data Engine, curating 16.9M expert trajectories and 5.0M reasoning samples across 7,802 high-fidelity 3D scenes (10.7 $\text{km}^2$). ABot-N0 achieves new SOTA performance across 7 benchmarks, significantly outperforming specialized models.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

Conclusion: HAIC 提高了人形机器人在复杂操控任务中的成功率，尤其在动态不确定环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

Conclusion: FAST明确优于目前的最先进方法，在鲁棒性、适应效率和泛化性能方面表现突出。

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

Conclusion: Robot-DIFT框架通过曼ifold蒸馏有效地改善了机器人操作中的几何一致性和控制性能，表明模型的视觉学习方式直接影响其行动学习能力。

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial-surface robot teams are promising for maritime monitoring. Robust deployment requires reliable perception over reflective water and scalable coordination under limited communication. We present a decentralized multi-robot framework for detecting and tracking floating containers using multiple UAVs cooperating with an autonomous surface vessel. Each UAV performs YOLOv8 and stereo-disparity-based visual detection, then tracks targets with per-object EKFs using uncertainty-aware data association. Compact track summaries are exchanged and fused conservatively via covariance intersection, ensuring consistency under unknown correlations. An information-driven assignment module allocates targets and selects UAV hover viewpoints by trading expected uncertainty reduction against travel effort and safety separation. Simulation results in a maritime scenario demonstrate improved coverage, localization accuracy, and tracking consistency while maintaining modest communication requirements.

Abstract: MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics. Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

Abstract: Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration of environments where communication is limited. This work introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a novel communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to share information efficiently without unnecessary backtracking. We further explore an extension to this approach called ART-SST, which enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery. Through over 480 simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperforms existing strategies, including full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristic approaches, achieving up to a 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods. These results demonstrate that adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Conclusion: LDA-1B模型通过利用通用的身体数据，显著提升了机器人在多种任务上的表现，并展现了数据高效微调的潜力。

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

Conclusion: AHAT在处理以人类风格的模糊指令为基础的家庭任务时表现出显著的性能提升，尤其是在复杂执行计划的情况下。

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.
