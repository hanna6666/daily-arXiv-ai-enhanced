We introduce the \"Red-Green-Gray\" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes."}

Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods."}

Our key insight is a reinforcement learning-driven musculoskeletal forward simulation that generates biomechanically plausible motion sequences consistent with events recorded in touch logs. We achieve this by integrating a software emulator into a physics simulator, allowing biomechanical models to manipulate real applications in real-time. Log2Motion produces rich syntheses of user movements from touch logs, including estimates of motion, speed, accuracy, and effort. We assess the plausibility of generated movements by comparing against human data from a motion capture study and prior findings, and demonstrate Log2Motion in a large-scale dataset. Biomechanical motion synthesis provides a new way to understand log data, illuminating the ergonomics and motor control underlying touch interactions."}

To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles.

We formulate subjective-report prediction as a supervised regression problem and propose a DenseNet-based deep learning regressor that learns predictive representations from gaze velocity signals. We conduct two complementary experiments to clarify our aims.

Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight."}

However, such data also raises privacy concerns because gaze sequences can encode subjects' internal states, like fatigue, emotional load, or stress. Ideally, synthetic gaze should preserve the signal quality of real recordings and remove or attenuate state-related, privacy-sensitive attributes. Many recent DL-based generative models focus on replicating real gaze trajectories and do not explicitly consider subjective reports or the privatization of internal states. However, in this work, we consider a recent diffusion-based gaze synthesis approach and examine correlations between synthetic gaze features and subjective reports (e.g., fatigue and related self-reported states). Our result shows that these correlations are trivial, which suggests the generative approach suppresses state-related features. Moreover, synthetic gaze preserves necessary signal characteristics similar to those of real data, which supports its use for privacy-preserving gaze-based applications."}

A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change."}

Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer.\n  To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language.\n  Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware. This enables real-time, in-situ visual intervention at the site of image capture, supporting participatory engagement with Anthropocene landscapes.\n  By coupling domain-specific NST optimization with mobile deployment, AnthropoCam reframes neural style transfer as a practical and expressive tool for real-time environmental visualization in the Anthropocene."}

However, such scenarios can afford only a brief auditory exposure, requiring users to interpret sound direction quickly and without extended listening or head-driven refinement. This paper reports a controlled exploratory study of rapid spatial-audio localization in XR. Using HRTF-rendered broadband stimuli presented from a semi-dense set of directions around the listener, we quantify how accurately users can infer coarse direction from brief audio alone. We further examine the effects of short-term visuo-auditory feedback training as a lightweight calibration mechanism. Our findings show that brief spatial cues can convey coarse directional information, and that even short calibration can improve users' perception of aural signals. While these results highlight the potential of spatial audio for rapid attention guidance, they also show that auditory cues alone may not provide sufficient precision for complex or high-stakes tasks, and that spatial audio may be most effective when complemented by other sensory modalities or visual cues, without relying on head-driven refinement. We leverage this study on spatial audio as a preliminary investigation into a first-stage attention-guidance channel for wearable XR (e.g., VR head-mounted displays and AR smart glasses), and provide design insights on stimulus selection and calibration for time-critical use."}

However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy."}

However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning."}

Accurate predictions about the other group's use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamental for such trust. However, the disruptive rise of AI has transformed academic work practices, raising important questions about how teachers and students use these tools and how well they can estimate each other's usage. While the frequency of use is well studied, little is known about how AI is used, and comparisons with similar practices are rare. This study surveyed German university teachers (N = 113) and students (N = 123) on the frequency of AI use and the degree of delegation across six identical academic tasks. Participants also provided incentivized cross-sample predictions of the other group's AI use to assess the accuracy of their predictions. We find that students reported higher use of AI and greater delegation than teachers. Both groups significantly overestimated the other group's use, with teachers predicting very frequent use and high delegation by students, and students assuming teachers use AI similarly to themselves. These findings reveal a perception gap between teachers' and students' expectations and actual AI use. Such gaps may hinder trust and effective collaboration, underscoring the need for open dialogue about AI practices in academia and for policies that support the equitable and transparent integration of AI tools in higher education."}

Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments.

Instead of viewing AI merely as a technical tool, the analysis emphasizes the importance of embedding AI into communication, collaboration, and decision-making processes within organizations from a human-centered perspective. Ten case-based patterns illustrate how AI support of predictive maintenance can be organized to address quality assurance and continuous improvement and to provide different types of sup-port for HCAI. The analysis shows that AI adoption often requires and enables new forms of organizational learning, where specialists jointly interpret AI output, adapt workflows, and refine rules for system improve-ment. Different dimensions and levels of socio-technical integration of AI are considered to reflect the effort and benefits of keeping the organization in the loop."}

A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations."}

Yet, most prior work has focused on detecting perpetrators' behaviors, leaving a limited understanding of how teens might respond to such unwanted advances. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey with 74 participants -- 51 parents and 23 teens -- who responded to simulated cybergrooming scenarios in two ways: responses that they think would make teens more vulnerable or resilient to unwanted sexual advances. Through a mixed-methods analysis, we identified four types of vulnerable responses (encouraging escalation, accepting an advance, displaying vulnerability, and negating risk concern) and four types of protective strategies (setting boundaries, directly declining, signaling risk awareness, and leveraging avoidance techniques). As the cybergrooming risk escalated, both vulnerable responses and protective strategies showed a corresponding progression. This study contributes a teen-centered understanding of cybergrooming, a labeled dataset, and a stage-based taxonomy of perceived protective strategies, while offering implications for educational programs and sociotechnical interventions."}

Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments."}

We systematically vary the density of low-quality AI systems and the depth of disclosure requirements in a simulated AI product market to gauge how people react to the risk of accidentally relying on a low-quality AI system. Then, we compare participants' choices to a rational Bayesian model, analyzing the degree to which partial information disclosure can improve AI adoption. Our results underscore the deleterious effects of information asymmetries on AI adoption, but also highlight the potential of partial disclosure designs to improve the overall efficiency of human decision-making."}

To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis."}

In total, our search returned 3,538 papers upon which we selected, based on PRISMA-ScR, a total of 46 papers for in-depth analysis. Our initial findings highlight that most papers take on a therapeutic or intervention perspective instead of a more positive support perspective.

Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving."}

We present a year-long study on the longitudinal use of AI in a high-stakes workplace among cancer specialists. Initial operational gains hid ``intuition rust'': the gradual dulling of expert judgment. These asymptomatic effects evolved into chronic harms, such as skill atrophy and identity commoditization. Building on these findings, we offer a framework for dignified Human-AI interaction co-constructed with professional knowledge workers facing AI-induced skill erosion without traditional labor protections. The framework operationalizes sociotechnical immunity through dual-purpose mechanisms that serve institutional quality goals while building worker power to detect, contain, and recover from skill erosion, and preserve human identity. Evaluated across healthcare and software engineering, our work takes a foundational step toward dignified human-AI interaction futures by balancing productivity with the preservation of human expertise."}

DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments."}

We propose leveraging Brain Foundation Models (BFMs), large pre-trained neural networks, to extract generalizable EEG features for cognitive load estimation. We adapt BFMs for long-term EEG monitoring and show that fine-tuning a small subset of layers yields improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Despite their scale, BFMs allow for real-time inference with a longer context window. To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance. Our findings reveal consistent emphasis on prefrontal regions linked to cognitive control, while longitudinal trends suggest learning progression. These results position BFMs as efficient and interpretable tools for continuous cognitive load monitoring in real-world BCIs."}

Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods."}

Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation."}

The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model."}

The dataset time-synchronizes eye-tracking signals (pupil diameter, fixations, saccades, eye gaze, gaze transition entropy, fixation dispersion index) with environmental real-time and continuous measurements (illuminance) and task and robot context (bench, task block, induced faults), under controlled manipulations of task difficulty and ambient conditions. For each participant and workload-graded task block, we provide CSV files with ocular metrics aggregated into 250 ms windows, environmental logs, and self-reported mental workload ratings on a 1-10 Likert scale, organized in participant-specific folders alongside documentation. These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers."}

Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate."}

While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications."}

However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released."}

We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery."}

For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg."}

However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released."}

We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection."}
