Presented at the 2025 International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER)", "summary": "To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

However, current teleoperation platforms typically lack integrated force feedback, cross-embodiment generalization, and portable, user-friendly designs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce ACE-F, a cross embodiment foldable teleoperation system with integrated force feedback. Our approach leverages inverse kinematics (IK) combined with a carefully designed human-robot interface (HRI), enabling users to capture precise and high-quality demonstrations effortlessly. We further propose a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics to ensure robot safety and precise motion control across diverse robotic embodiments. Critically, to achieve cross-embodiment generalization of force feedback without additional sensors, we innovatively interpret end-effector positional deviations as virtual force signals, which enhance data collection and enable applications in imitation learning. Extensive teleoperation experiments confirm that ACE-F significantly simplifies the control of various robot embodiments, making dexterous manipulation tasks as intuitive as operating a computer mouse.

This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\\\ \\href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u4e2a\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u5185\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u672a\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ecd\u7136\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4e13\u5bb6\u8981\u6c42\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08RCT\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u671f\u4e03\u5468\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08n=81\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d8\u79cd\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u5728\u996e\u98df\u6210\u679c\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u798f\u7949\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d89\u53caLLMs\u5728\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u672a\u96c6\u6210LLMs\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u996e\u98df\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u798f\u7949\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.", "AI": {"tldr": "DA-SIP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a7\u5236\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56f0\u96be\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6b65\u9aa4\u9884\u7b97\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u53d8\u4f53\u548cODE/SDE\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u611f\u77e5\u968f\u673a\u63d2\u503c\u7b56\u7565\uff08DA-SIP\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0cDA-SIP\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

Yet it remains unclear how reliably they advise students, and how often otherwise helpful answers drift into unsupported claims (``hallucinations'').\n  This work provides a clear, domain-grounded overview of how current LLMs behave in this setting. Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence). These questions are categorized by domain scope which can be a single-domain or multi-domain -- when it must integrate evidence across areas such as admissions, visas, and scholarships.\n  To reflect real advising quality, we grade answers with a simple rubric which is correct, partial, or wrong. The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.\n  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.\n  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u54a8\u8be2\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9ApplyBoard\u7684\u54a8\u8be2\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u504f\u79bb\u548c\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5931\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ba1\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

The system integrates Indic ASR, a codeaware transcription refinement module, and a code model for generating relevant answers. Responses are provided in both text and audio for natural interaction. In a study with 28 beginner programmers, CodeVaani achieved 75% response accuracy, with over 80% of participants rating the experience positively.

Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory.

We introduce a generative AI framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of interactive geospatial dashboards from user-defined inputs including UI wireframes, requirements, and data sources. By incorporating a structured knowledge graph, the workflow embeds domain knowledge into the generation process and enable accurate and context-aware code completions. A key component of our approach is the Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP) mechanism, which extracts encodes and interface semantics from visual layouts to guide LLM driven generation of codes. The new framework also integrates a self-validation mechanism that uses an agent-based LLM and Pass@k evaluation alongside semantic metrics to assure output reliability. Dashboard snippets are paired with data visualization codebases and ontological representations, enabling a pipeline that produces scalable React-based completions using the MVVM architectural pattern. Our results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches and expanded functionality over third party platforms, while incorporating multi-page, fully functional interfaces. We successfully developed a framework to implement LLMs, demonstrated the pipeline for automated code generation, deployment, and performed chain-of-thought AI agents in self-validation.

However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faMaglev-Pentabot\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u514b\u7ea7\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67092D\u548c3D\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u63a7\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u514b\u7ea7\u5bf9\u8c61\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7535\u78c1\u4f53\u6392\u5217\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u63a7\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5927\u7535\u78c1\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u91cd\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Maglev-Pentabot\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u63a7\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u8f93\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While previous reviews have focused on specific aspects of this field, there has been limited comprehensive research that encompasses emotion understanding, elicitation, and expression, along with the related challenges. This survey addresses this gap by providing a holistic overview of core components of artificial emotion intelligence. It covers emotion understanding through multimodal data processing, as well as affective cognition, which includes cognitive appraisal, emotion mapping, and adaptive modulation in decision-making, learning, and reasoning. Additionally, it addresses the synthesis of emotional expression across text, speech, and facial modalities to enhance human-agent interaction. This paper identifies and analyzes the key challenges and issues encountered in the development of affective systems, covering state-of-the-art methodologies designed to address them.

We proposed that embedding Physical Web applications that are engaging and interactive in public open spaces as part of interactive wellness parks can encourage older adults to participate in physical activities outdoors and motivate rehabilitation. We have created an initial design prototype based on design requirements generated from a qualitative field study with 24 older adults to explore their perceptions, experiences, and routines of outdoor physical activities. In this paper, we present an initial prototype and findings from a co-design session with 12 older adults, eliciting their feedback on the design and their ideas for future design iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528Physical Web\u6280\u672f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u6237\u5916\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u79d1\u6280\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u6237\u5916\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5eb7\u590d\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u8eab\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u578b\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u6536\u96c6", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u6b65\u539f\u578b\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u4e8612\u540d\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u63a8\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u6237\u5916\u8eab\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5065\u5eb7\u3002"}}

However, existing loco-manipulation methods primarily focus on dexterous manipulation, falling short of the combined requirements for dexterity and proactive force interaction in high-load industrial scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework with a decoupled three-stage training pipeline, consisting of an upper-body policy, a lower-body policy, and a delta-command policy. To accelerate upper-body training, a heuristic reward function is designed. By implicitly embedding forward kinematics priors, it enables the policy to converge faster and achieve superior performance.

Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Gemini in generating accurate and context-sensitive scripts for visually rich academic presentations, while Polly provides natural-sounding narration with controllable pacing. A two course pilot study was conducted to evaluate AI generated instructional videos (AIIV) against human instructional videos (HIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that AIIVs are comparable to HIVs in terms of learning outcomes, with students reporting high levels of clarity, coherence, and usability.

Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u91cd\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u7684IMU\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u4e92\u76f8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eIMU\u9884\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684IMU\u9884\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c0f\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u3002"}}

However, these frameworks expect acute, tangible harms and thus may not cover the full range of human experience relevant to modern-day digital privacy. To address this gap, our research builds upon these existing frameworks to develop a more comprehensive representation of people's lived experiences with privacy harms. We analyzed 369 privacy incidents reported by individuals from the general public. We found a broader range of privacy incidents and harms than accounted for in existing legal frameworks.

A critical limitation of such learning-based approaches, however, is their difficulty in generalizing to novel scenarios, especially within cluttered environments. This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles. Our contribution is a customized Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, \\textbf{guided by carefully designed task-specific cost functions,} that uses GPU-accelerated MuJoCo for efficiently evaluating robot-object interaction. We apply this method to solve significantly more challenging versions of tasks from the PerAct$^{2}$ benchmark, such as requiring the point-to-point transfer of a ball through an obstacle course. Furthermore, we establish that our method achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs and facilitates successful sim-to-real transfer by leveraging unique features within MuJoCo.

We leverage deep neural networks to encode a single range image, capturing all the available information about the environment, into a Signed Distance Function (SDF). The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot. First, a theoretical analysis of the contributed NMPC is conducted, verifying recursive feasibility and stability properties under fixed observations. Subsequently, we evaluate the open-loop performance of the learning-based components as well as the closed-loop performance of the controller in simulations and experiments. The simulation study includes an ablation study, comparisons with two state-of-the-art local navigation methods, and an assessment of the resilience to drifting odometry. The real-world experiments are conducted in forest environments, demonstrating that the neural NMPC effectively performs collision avoidance in cluttered settings against an adversarial reference velocity input and drifting position estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684NMPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5730\u56fe\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5730\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u8303\u56f4\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3aSDF\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ea7\u8054\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08NMPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5730\u56fe\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u8f7d\u8303\u56f4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u5355\u4e2a\u8303\u56f4\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\uff08SDF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u795e\u7ecfNMPC\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average.

However, a significant challenge arises in delivering haptic feedback to users' hands, due to the necessity for the hands to remain bare. In response to this challenge, recent research has proposed an indirect solution of providing haptic feedback to the forearm. In this work, we present QuadStretcher, a skin stretch display featuring four independently controlled stretching units surrounding the forearm. While achieving rich haptic expression, our device also eliminates the need for a grounding base on the forearm by using a pair of counteracting tactors, thereby reducing bulkiness. To assess the effectiveness of QuadStretcher in facilitating immersive bare-hand experiences, we conducted a comparative user evaluation (n = 20) with a baseline solution, Squeezer. The results confirmed that QuadStretcher outperformed Squeezer in terms of expressing force direction and heightening the sense of realism, particularly in 3-DoF VR interactions such as pulling a rubber band, hooking a fishing rod, and swinging a tennis racket.

To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0.

This study examined whether using generative AI during decision making enhances choice satisfaction and reduces choice difficulty among older adults. A total of 130 participants (younger: 56; older: 74) completed a music-selection task under AI-use and AI-nonuse conditions across two contexts: previously experienced (road trip) and not previously experienced (space travel). In the AI-nonuse condition, participants generated candidate options from memory; in the AI-use condition, GPT-4o presented options tailored to individual preferences. To assess cognitive function, we also administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition. Results revealed that in the AI-nonuse condition, older adults with lower cognitive function reported higher choice difficulty and lower choice satisfaction. Under the AI-use condition, choice satisfaction did not change significantly, but perceived choice difficulty decreased significantly in both age groups. Moreover, AI use attenuated the associations observed among older adults between lower cognitive function and both greater difficulty and lower satisfaction. These findings indicate that preference-aligned option recommendations generated by AI can compensate for age-related constraints on information search, thereby reducing perceived choice difficulty without diminishing satisfaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u578bAI\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u578bAI\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528AI\u65f6\uff0c\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u5927\uff1bAI\u5e2e\u52a9\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u53ca\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9009\u9879\u63a8\u8350\u80fd\u591f\u8865\u507f\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u611f\u89c9\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff08MPA\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347E2E\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "E2E\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5faa\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5374\u5bb9\u6613\u906d\u9047\u7ea7\u8054\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MPA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5f15\u64ce\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u653f\u7b56\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u591a\u6b65Q\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cMPA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u3001\u9886\u57df\u5916\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "MPA\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86E2E\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models.

Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario.

A small but growing line of research has explored tools and processes to better engage non-AI expert users in auditing generative AI systems. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of MIRAGE, a web-based tool exploring a \"contrast-first\" workflow that allows users to pick up to four different text-to-image (T2I) models, view their images side-by-side, and provide feedback on model performance on a single screen. In our user study with fifteen participants, we used four predefined models for consistency, with only a single model initially being shown. We found that most participants shifted from analyzing individual images to general model output patterns once the side-by-side step appeared with all four models; several participants coined persistent \"model personalities\" (e.g., cartoonish, saturated) that helped them form expectations about how each model would behave on future prompts. Bilingual participants also surfaced a language-fidelity gap, as English prompts produced more accurate images than Portuguese or Chinese, an issue often overlooked when dealing with a single model. These findings suggest that simple comparative interfaces can accelerate bias discovery and reshape how people think about generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faMIRAGE\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u6392\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u975eAI\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f51\u9875\u5de5\u5177MIRAGE\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u6392\u6bd4\u8f83\u6b65\u9aa4\u540e\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u8f6c\u5411\u4e00\u822c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684'\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027'\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff1b\u53cc\u8bed\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u591f\u52a0\u901f\u504f\u89c1\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5851\u9020\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u8003\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D \"trace-space\" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6c14\u8c61\u7684TraceGen\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u793a\u8303\u4e0b\u5b66\u4f1a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u540d\u4e3aTraceGen\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053TraceForge\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "TraceGen\u5728123K\u89c6\u9891\u548c1.8M\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f68\u8ff9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ec5\u9700\u4e94\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523080%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5feb50-600\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u4e94\u4e2a\u975e\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u624b\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u8fbe\u523067.5%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TraceGen\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u91cd\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Conventional deep models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers have advanced HAR but remain limited by vanishing or exloding gradients, high computational cost, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Structured state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba address these challenges with linear complexity and effective temporal modeling, yet they are restricted to first-order dynamics without stable longterm memory mechanisms. We introduce Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented SSM that incorporates second-order dynamics to improve stability of information flow across time steps, robustness, and long-sequence modeling. Two extensions further expand its capacity: Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling. Experiments on multiple HAR benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over vanilla Mamba and Transformer baselines in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed. With only moderate increases in training cost, momentum-augmented SSMs offer a favorable accuracy-efficiency balance, establishing them as a scalable paradigm for HAR and a promising principal framework for broader sequence modeling applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165Momentum Mamba\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09\u5728\u666e\u9002\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u73af\u5883\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08Momentum Mamba\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578bMomentum Mamba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Momentum Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2aHAR\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e3aHAR\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
