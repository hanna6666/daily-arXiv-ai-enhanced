Distilling multiple VFMs into a\nunified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields\ninflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training\nto incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert\ntransformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs\ninto a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing\nnetwork (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant\nexperts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further\nintroduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve\nboth flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER\nsupports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and\nadaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks\nand multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking\nfailure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate\ndynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its\nfidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking\nresolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the\nfidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed\nscheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity\nvariations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or\ninsufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a\nlearning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically\nadjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse\nenvironments.

To address these issues, we\npropose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a\nnovel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic\nperformance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the\nlearning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and\na downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer\nmodule is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract\ntemporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual\ninputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract\nvisual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is\ndiscarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged\naccess to global state information supervises the agent during early training\nto provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This\nguidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training\nprogresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments\ndemonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic\npolicy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and\nperceptually complex scenarios."}

However,\ntraditional studies using flat screens fail to capture the cognitive dynamics\nof this process over the large visual fields of real-world scenes. To address\nthis gap, we developed an immersive virtual reality system with integrated\neye-tracking to investigate the interplay between attention and memory during\ncomplex enumeration. We conducted a two-phase experiment where participants\nenumerated scenes of either simple abstract shapes or complex real-world\nobjects, systematically varying the task intent (e.g., selective vs. exhaustive\ncounting) and the spatial layout of items. Our results reveal that task intent\nis the dominant factor driving performance, with selective counting imposing a\nsignificant cognitive cost that was dramatically amplified by stimulus\ncomplexity. The semantic processing required for real-world objects reduced\naccuracy and suppressed memory recall, while the influence of spatial layout\nwas secondary and statistically non-significant when a higher-order cognitive\ntask intent was driving the human behaviour. We conclude that real-world\nenumeration is fundamentally constrained by the cognitive load of semantic\nprocessing, not just the mechanics of visual search.

We\nintroduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric\nquantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing\nmechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to\nimprove generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a\nnovel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen\nhairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral\n(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair\nstyling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model\noutperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen\nhairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling\ntasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error\nand 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world\nexperiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving\nconsistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art\nsystem fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based\nrobot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible\nrobot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.

Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse\nenvironments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited\ninterpretability.In this work, we introduce EmbodiedCoder, a training-free\nframework for open-world mobile robot manipulation that leverages coding models\nto directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level\ninstructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry\nparameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data\ncollection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and\ngeneralizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real\nmobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across\ndiverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and\nenvironments.Our results demonstrate an interpretable approach for bridging\nhigh-level reasoning and low-level control, moving beyond fixed primitives\ntoward versatile robot intelligence.
