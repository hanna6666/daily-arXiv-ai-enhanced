Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究设计了一个思维交流界面，通过三种条件评估其对初级研究者批判性阅读的支持，结果表明代理介导的交流显著提高了批判性思维能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者批判性阅读能力的提升受限于缺乏不同观点的同伴交流，因此设计思维交流界面以解决这一问题。

Method: 通过设计一个基于思维交流的界面，并对46名初级研究者进行三种条件（无代理、单代理和多代理）的效果评估。

Result: 加入代理介导的思维交流后，参与者的批判性思维得分显著提升，在单代理条件下，参与者更频繁地进行反思性注释；在多代理条件下，参与者对代理回应的互动更加积极，并能够比较分析多种观点。

Conclusion: 在多代理条件下，参与者能够更积极地与代理的回应进行互动，从而提高了批判性思维能力，而设计基于AI的思维交流界面有助于支持研究人员的批判性读取能力。

Abstract: Critical reading is a primary way through which researchers develop their
critical thinking skills. While exchanging thoughts and opinions with peers can
strengthen critical reading, junior researchers often lack access to peers who
can offer diverse perspectives. To address this gap, we designed an in-situ
thought exchange interface informed by peer feedback from a formative study
(N=8) to support junior researchers' critical paper reading. We evaluated the
effects of thought exchanges under three conditions (no-agent, single-agent,
and multi-agent) with 46 junior researchers over two weeks. Our results showed
that incorporating agent-mediated thought exchanges during paper reading
significantly improved participants' critical thinking scores compared to the
no-agent condition. In the single-agent condition, participants more frequently
made reflective annotations on the paper content. In the multi-agent condition,
participants engaged more actively with agents' responses. Our qualitative
analysis further revealed that participants compared and analyzed multiple
perspectives in the multi-agent condition. This work contributes to
understanding in-situ AI-based support for critical paper reading through
thought exchanges and offers design implications for future research.

*Roel Boumans,Lisa Cramer,Sascha van de Poll,Henria Vermeulen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种利用大语言模型和检索增强生成技术的虚拟人类化身，以提高患者和家属在医疗信息上的可用性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医疗专业人员时间有限，患者及其家属的信息需求很高，因此希望通过虚拟化身来弥补这一缺口。

Method: 通过制作两个患者与化身的互动视频，进行一项针对165名参与者的问卷调查，评估他们在观看视频时的可用性和信任度。

Result: 在患者角色中可用性评分为M=4.61（SD=0.97），信任度为M=3.92（SD=1.10）；在其亲属角色中可用性评分为M=4.64（SD=1.08），信任度为M=4.31（SD=1.06）。

Conclusion: 虚拟化身在患者和家属中的可用性和信任度普遍较高，但性别、国家和教育水平对结果没有显著影响。

Abstract: Healthcare professionals have limited time to support patients and their
relatives, but their information needs are high. Therefore, the Radboud
University together with the Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital hospital developed a
speaking virtual hu-man avatar which, contrary to many avatars, uses a Large
Language Model (LLM) enhanced with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The
RAG tech-nique enables medical information supplied by the hospital to be
utilized during interactions, rather than generic LLM information. Two videos
were produced, one presenting a patient-avatar interaction regarding a total
hip surgery, and an-other one presenting an interaction between a relative of a
patient and the avatar concerning postoperative delirium. A survey was
conducted among adults over 40 from the Netherlands, the UK and the USA to
study the effects of gender, country and education level on usability and
trust, which are important factors for avatar acceptance. Participants watched
videos, imagining themselves as the pa-tient (video 1) or relative (video 2),
and rated the constructs on a 7-point Likert scale (0-6). 165 persons
(MeanAge=51.6, SDAge=8.9, Male=80, Female=85) completed the survey. In the
patient role, participants scored the usability as M=4.61 (SD=0.97) and trust
as M=3.92 (SD=1.10), all above the mean scale value. In the role as relative to
the patient, participants scored usability as M=4.64 (SD=1.08) and trust as
M=4.31 (SD=1.06). No effects were found of gender, country and education level.

### [3] [The Spark Effect: On Engineering Creative Diversity in Multi-Agent AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15568)
*Alexander Doudkin,Anton Voelker,Friedrich von Borries*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Art of X开发了角色条件的LLM代理（Spark），显著提升了创意输出的多样性，接近人类创意水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创意服务团队依赖大型语言模型加速创意生成，但生产系统常导致输出同质化，无法满足品牌或艺术期望。

Method: 开发了以角色为条件的LLM代理

Result: 使用角色条件的Spark代理替换统一系统提示，平均多样性提高了4.1分，接近人类专家仅差1.0分。

Conclusion: 研究显示，角色条件的代理可以有效增加创意多样性，并提出了未来部署的评估偏差和程序考量。

Abstract: Creative services teams increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to
accelerate ideation, yet production systems often converge on homogeneous
outputs that fail to meet brand or artistic expectations. Art of X developed
persona-conditioned LLM agents -- internally branded as "Sparks" and
instantiated through a library of role-inspired system prompts -- to
intentionally diversify agent behaviour within a multi-agent workflow. This
white paper documents the problem framing, experimental design, and
quantitative evidence behind the Spark agent programme. Using an LLM-as-a-judge
protocol calibrated against human gold standards, we observe a mean diversity
gain of +4.1 points (on a 1-10 scale) when persona-conditioned Spark agents
replace a uniform system prompt, narrowing the gap to human experts to 1.0
point. We also surface evaluator bias and procedural considerations for future
deployments.

pragmatic purposes, we wonder how we can design and implement ambient
artificial intelligence experiences in public spaces that elicit deep human
feelings of awe, wonder, and beauty. As a manifestation, we introduce Sound
Clouds, an immersive art installation that generates live music based on
participants' interaction with several human-height spheres. Our installation
serves as a provocation into future ambient intelligence that provokes, not

### [5] [Autonomous Reactive Masonry Construction using Collaborative Heterogeneous Aerial Robots with Experimental Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15114)
*Marios-Nektarios Stamatopoulos,Elias Small,Shridhar Velhal,Avijit Banerjee,George Nikolakopoulos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于异构无人机的全自主空中砖石建筑施工框架，展示了其高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无人机在建筑施工中的应用，尤其是在砖石建筑施工领域，以提升施工效率和精确度。

Method: 通过开发两种专门的无人机，结合动态任务分配、实时环境反馈和先进的视觉系统，实现砖块的精确拾取、放置和粘合。

Result: 提出了一种利用异构无人机进行全自主空中砖石建筑施工的框架，并进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: 该框架的实验结果表明，其在未来自主空中机器人建筑施工方面具有潜力和基础。

Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction
framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by
experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)
a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise
brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled
valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed
framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency
graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous
task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and
safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows
real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory
generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and
placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system
that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares
optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental
demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using
heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another
autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results
supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and
demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in
autonomous aerial robotic construction.

### [6] [RM-RL: Role-Model Reinforcement Learning for Precise Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15189)
*Xiangyu Chen,Chuhao Zhou,Yuxi Liu,Jianfei Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架RM-RL，通过角色模型策略改善了机器人操作的在线和离线学习效率，减少了对人类示范的依赖，实验结果表明其性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在精细操作任务中，依赖于人工示范的学习方式存在时间长、效率低的问题，现有的离线强化学习方法也面临着分布转移和数据效率低的问题，因此需要一个新框架来提高操作的精度和效率。

Method: 该方法采用角色模型策略生成在线训练数据的标签，通过监督学习重新构造策略学习，减少了由于分布不匹配带来的不稳定性，并通过混合训练方案增强数据效率。

Result: RM-RL框架在实际环境中统一了在线和离线训练，显著提高了机器人精确操作的效率和稳定性，并在挑战性任务中显示出优越性。

Conclusion: RM-RL框架通过优化在线和离线训练，实现了高效且稳定的机器人操作，在精度提升方面取得显著成果，证明了其在处理复杂任务上的有效性。

Abstract: Precise robot manipulation is critical for fine-grained applications such as
chemical and biological experiments, where even small errors (e.g., reagent
spillage) can invalidate an entire task. Existing approaches often rely on
pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning
(IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality
demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while
offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency.
We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies
online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a
role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training
data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human
demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training,
reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A
hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline
reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive
experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL
methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement
in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate
onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods
fail.

### [7] [Lagrange-Poincaré-Kepler Equations of Disturbed Space-Manipulator Systems in Orbit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15199)
*Borna Monazzah Moghaddam,Robin Chhabra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出的Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler方程有效整合了航天器姿态、轨道运动与操纵器运动学，适用于非惯性轨道下的系统动态建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究航天器-操纵器系统的动态特性，以应对非惯性参考框架中运动造成的复杂性，并推动自主机器人在轨道环境中的应用。

Method: 通过结合基础航天器的Euler-Poincare方程、参考框架的开普勒轨道动力学和操纵器形状空间的简化Euler-Lagrange方程，使用指数关节参数化来推导出新的结构矩阵。

Result: 通过数值模拟研究，展示了所提出模型的有效性和对航天器上7自由度操纵器的轨道效应的分析，验证了模型的数值优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler方程（LPKE）有效模型化了在非惯性轨道参考框架内航天器-操纵器系统的动态，以提高航天任务中的操控性能。

Abstract: This article presents an extension of the Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE)
to model the dynamics of spacecraft-manipulator systems operating within a
non-inertial orbital reference frame. Building upon prior formulations of LPE
for vehicle-manipulator systems, the proposed framework, termed the
Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE), incorporates the coupling between
spacecraft attitude dynamics, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics. The
formalism combines the Euler-Poincare equations for the base spacecraft,
Keplerian orbital dynamics for the reference frame, and reduced Euler-Lagrange
equations for the manipulator's shape space, using an exponential joint
parametrization. Leveraging the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal
bundles, we derive novel closed-form structural matrices that explicitly
capture the effects of orbital disturbances and their dynamic coupling with the
manipulator system. The LPKE framework also systematically includes externally
applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches, allowing for immediate integration into
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and model-based control architectures for
autonomous robotic operations in the orbital environment. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and its numerical superiority, we present a
simulation study analyzing orbital effects on a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator
mounted on a spacecraft.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的传感器融合SLAM方法在复杂环境中仍易受估计漂移的影响，需改进融合策略以确保安全高效的机器人导航。

Result: 与其他传感器融合SLAM算法相比，该方法在公共和长期数据集上表现出较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合多种传感器数据，所提方法显著提升了在复杂和动态环境中腿式机器人导航的稳定性和精确性。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments
relies on robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
accurately map surroundings and localize the robot, ensuring safe and efficient
operation. While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated
various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are
still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their
reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust
LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information
from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit
(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our
system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs
optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based
LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In
VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth
consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In
LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an
error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor
fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across
public and longterm datasets.

### [9] [PolyFly: Polytopic Optimal Planning for Collision-Free Cable-Suspended Aerial Payload Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15226)

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升悬挂电缆空中运输机器人在灾害响应和救援操作中的能力，需在狭窄环境中快速飞行，同时避免障碍物。

Method: 通过将环境和机器人建模为独立的多面体，并结合其姿态构建面向方向的多面体，提出了一种优化的全局规划方法。

Result: 与现有最先进的方法相比，PolyFly在八个迷宫环境中生成了更快的轨迹。

Conclusion: PolyFly能够提供更快的轨迹规划，并且在真实四旋翼实验中验证了其可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
method.

### [10] [A Generalized Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli problem with application in disaster relief operations by UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15229)

Conclusion: 该框架通过考虑真实的环境因素（如风和无人机的异质性），显著提升了无人机灾后响应计划的实用性，并可减少高达84%的作业时间。

Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

Conclusion: 通过聚焦于可通行性信息，该方法能显著提升语义一致性和位置图优化的计算效率。

Abstract: Scene graphs enhance 3D mapping capabilities in robotics by understanding the
relationships between different spatial elements, such as rooms and objects.
Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and
leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated
with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy
simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently
recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and
limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time
approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces
that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent
method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often
under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are
non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in
pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation
method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with
consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the
semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization.
Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the
same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along
the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.

*Gahee Kim,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种主动模拟推理方法，通过优化机器人收集信息以准确估计黑箱模拟器的参数，算法基于神经网络学习后验估计，实验结果表明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在黑箱模拟器中，由于参数与观察之间的未知关系，获取足够的信息进行参数估计是具有挑战性的。

Method: ASBI 框架优化机器人行为以收集信息丰富的观察数据，通过最大化信息增益进行参数估计。

Result: 我们的实验表明，ASBI 方法在参数估计中表现出良好的准确性，后验分布集中在真实参数周围。此外，ASBI 被成功应用于使用真实机器人估计与实际物体（如珠子和沙砾）相关的模拟参数。

Conclusion: Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI) 提供了一种有效的框架来通过主动收集数据进行黑箱模拟器的精确参数估计。

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

*Liviu-Mihai Stan,Ranulfo Bezerra,Shotaro Kojima,Tsige Tadesse Alemayoh,Satoshi Tadokoro,Masashi Konyo,Kazunori Ohno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于灾害响应的机器人导航路径规划框架，能够识别并处理可移动障碍物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灾害响应及其他非结构化室内环境中，机器人需要避免障碍物并识别可推开的障碍物。

Method: 使用基于LiDAR和里程计的路径规划框架，嵌入ROS2 Nav2，新增可移动障碍物层，并利用慢速进程监测器调整导航成本。

Result: 在对Scout Mini进行的Gazebo评估中，与无层基线相比，在目标到达率和死锁数量上表现更佳，通行时间大致相当。

Conclusion: 互动感知的成本地图是一个轻量级的ROS2原生扩展，适用于在非结构化环境中导航时处理潜在的可移动障碍物。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
full implementation will be released as open source

Result: 提出了一种名为NOAH的新型自然启发式群体优化算法，解决了传统算法的关键局限性。

Conclusion: NOAH为水下探索任务提供了有效的能量管理和可扩展的群体机器人基础，成功验证了在永久锚定场景中的86%成功率。

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited
acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional
swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper presents NOAH, a novel
nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift,
irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based
communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH
addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing
hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based
communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The
algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and
energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.
Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring
scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and
irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for photorealistic robot simulation that
integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting as a drop-in renderer within vectorized
physics simulators such as IsaacGym. This enables unprecedented speed --
exceeding 100,000 steps per second on consumer GPUs -- while maintaining high
visual fidelity, which we showcase across diverse tasks. We additionally
demonstrate its applicability in a sim-to-real robotics setting. Beyond
depth-based sensing, our results highlight how rich visual semantics improve
navigation and decision-making, such as avoiding undesirable regions. We
further showcase the ease of incorporating thousands of environments from
iPhone scans, large-scale scene datasets (e.g., GrandTour, ARKit), and outputs
from generative video models like Veo, enabling rapid creation of realistic
training worlds. This work bridges high-throughput simulation and high-fidelity
perception, advancing scalable and generalizable robot learning. All code and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化鸡肩去骨的切割政策，通过创建多材料切割的模拟器和物理测试台，实现了6自由度的刀具控制，展示了在实际切割中显著提高的成功率和减少骨接触的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化鸡肩去骨的复杂性以及手动切割带来的健康安全风险促使了这一研究的开展。

Method: 开发了一个开放源代码的多材料切割模拟器和一个可重复使用的物理测试台，并训练了一种剩余强化学习策略以实现零-shot的模拟到现实转移。

Result: 通过我们的实验，学习到的政策能够可靠地避免接触骨骼，相较于现有的切割基线，成功率和骨接触的减少提高了最多4倍。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了在多材料切割中，力反馈的必要性，并取得了比现有的切割方法更优秀的效果。

Abstract: Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，动态环境和边缘案例对自我车辆的状态理解和决策造成巨大的挑战，因此设计一种能更好理解状态并进行决策的方法至关重要。

Method: VDRive 结合了视觉语言行动模型 (VLA) 和生成扩散策略，使用条件向量量化变分自编码器 (CVQ-VAE) 生成离散状态，并通过强化学习细化政策。

Result: VDRive 是一种新颖的端到端自动驾驶管道，通过明确建模状态-动作映射，提升了对动态环境和边缘案例挑战的应对能力，从而实现可解释且稳健的决策提高。

Conclusion: VDRive 在 Bench2Drive 和 nuScenes Benchmark 上的测试结果表明，其性能领先于现有方法，证明了该方法在自动驾驶中的有效性和可靠性。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
planning.

TL;DR: 本研究探究了集成预测与规划（IPP）方法的有效性，并提出一种新的提议生成方法，显著提高了在复杂驾驶场景下的规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨集成预测与规划（IPP）在自动驾驶中的有效性，以及如何提升规划性能。

Method: 分析了不同预测对规划影响，着重于高质量提议生成，而将预测主要用于碰撞检测。

Result: 通过增强的提议生成方法，建立了基于PDM的模型，在复杂场景下超越了现有的自动驾驶规划方法，创造了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 尽管集成预测和规划提供了潜在优势，但当前方法往往无法充分利用未来行为信息。本研究通过关注高质量提议生成，在复杂情况下取得了显著改善。

Abstract: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在模仿学习的背景下，虽然基于点云的方法在机器人操作中取得了显著成果，但缺乏对纯视觉解决方案的深入探索，而这些方案具有巨大潜力。

Method: 使用VGGT的中间特征，结合DINOv2的语义特征和交错注意力块的几何特征，通过交叉注意力实现特征融合，并通过CNN进行空间压缩，形成策略头的输入。

Result: 本研究提出了一种仅基于视觉的单视图扩散策略学习方法（VO-DP），通过预训练的视觉基础模型有效融合语义特征和几何特征，表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: VO-DP在不同条件下保持高度稳定，并且在多个实验中优于现有点云方法，显示了视觉方案在机器人操作中的前景。

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了干扰估计中跟踪速度与不确定性之间的固有权衡，提出了两种新方法，显著改善了关节跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械系统的名义性能常因未知干扰而下降，现有方法无法完全消除这种影响。

Method: 使用基于交互多模型扩展卡尔曼滤波器和多核相关熵扩展卡尔曼滤波器的干扰观察器。

Result: 在动态交互力情景下，所提方法在髋关节误差方面分别提高了$36.3\%$和$16.2\%$，在膝关节误差方面分别提高了$46.3\%$和$24.4\%$的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 提出的两种新型干扰估计方法在动态干扰场景中显著提高了跟踪精度，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: The nominal performance of mechanical systems is often degraded by unknown
disturbances. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal
performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection
is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we
reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking
speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance
disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended
Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify
that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and
$16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error,
respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance
observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 受未来自主技术的启发，四足机器人需要在面对未知干扰与复杂任务时，能够自主行动。

Conclusion: 算法在Gazebo和MuJoCo的模拟中验证，通过实时更新模型，能够在各种复杂环境中跟踪参考轨迹。

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning
and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting
modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual
dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external
disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will
autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such
as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier
features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual
dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least
squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The
algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the
suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the
residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations,
where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo
simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$,
where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain
with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.
The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload
up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.

Result: 构建出的手可以自适应地抓取各种物体，采用简单的驱动和控制机制。

Conclusion: 该教育软手的设计有潜力启发儿童学习现代机器人技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
modern robotics.

Motivation: 解决传统刚性或电缆连接在精度和扰动传递方面的局限性。

Method: 通过在配备 LiCAS 双臂操控器的四旋翼上进行遥操作实验来评估 VSL 的表现。

Result: 改变连杆的刚度显著影响 UAV 和有效载荷之间的动态互动，灵活配置减少外部冲击，而刚性配置增强了操控的定位精度。

Conclusion: VSL 增强了长距离空中操控的灵活性和安全性，提供了可控的顺应性和精度之间的权衡。

Abstract: This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
accuracy during manipulation phases.
  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.

Conclusion: 实验证明，该方法在不同模型上的重建精度高，具有良好的可靠性和适用性。

Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.

Conclusion: HEADER在大规模环境的自主机器人探索中表现出优越的可扩展性和探索效率，尤其是在复杂的实际场景中得到验证。

Abstract: This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot
exploration in terms of environmental scale and exploration efficiency. We
present HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with
hierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.
HEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical
representations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel
community-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains
fully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.
Building upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the
nearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant
information at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that
consider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we
introduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model
performance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding
training objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated
challenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better
scalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while
achieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over
state-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it
in complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus
environment.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot

Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution (DDACE). Our
approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal
sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring
modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and
spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,
significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from
demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted
extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action
dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task
execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across
dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular
architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot
