Unlike conventional quadrotors, which are underactuated, this class of quadrotors achieves full actuation, enabling independent motion in all six degrees of freedom. While existing omnidirectional quadrotor designs often require significant structural modifications, the proposed gimballed rotor system maintains a lightweight and easy-to-integrate design by incorporating servo motors within the rotor platforms, allowing independent tilting of each rotor without major alterations to the central structure of a quadrotor. To accommodate this unconventional design, we develop a new control allocation scheme in PX4 Autopilot and present successful flight tests, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e07\u5411\u65cb\u7ffc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5411\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e07\u5411\u65cb\u7ffc\u673a\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5411\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e07\u5411\u65cb\u7ffc\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u53ca\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u91cd\u5927\u6539\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5404\u65cb\u7ffc\u72ec\u7acb\u503e\u659c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7PX4\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eea\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u4e07\u5411\u65cb\u7ffc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms.

Results show that consequential sounds of the Kinova Gen3 manipulator did not negatively affect perceptions, spatial localization is highly accurate for lateral cues but declines for frontal cues, and spatial sounds can simultaneously convey task-relevant information while promoting warmth and reducing discomfort.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025", "summary": "Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general-shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u9001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u63a8\u9001\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u9001\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u6cdb\u5f62\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002"}}

We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a \"narrative mind\" that complements the \"weak,\" historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas.

We introduce Bi-AQUA, the first underwater bilateral control-based imitation learning framework that integrates lighting-aware visual processing for underwater robot arms. Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical. This work bridges terrestrial bilateral control-based imitation learning and underwater manipulation, enabling force-sensitive autonomous operation in challenging marine environments.

However, owing to the limited skin area and spatial acuity of the wrist, frequent confusions occur between closely located tactors, resulting in a low recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracies reported in previous studies have mostly been measured for a specific posture and could further decrease with free arm postures in real life. Herein, we present Heterogeneous Stroke, a design concept for improving the recognition accuracy of STPs on a WTD. By assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor, the confusion between tactors can be reduced.

To address this, we propose PIPHEN, an innovative distributed physical cognition-control framework. Its core idea is to replace \"raw data communication\" with \"semantic communication\" by performing \"semantic distillation\" at the robot edge, reconstructing high-dimensional perceptual data into compact, structured physical representations. This idea is primarily realized through two key components: (1) a novel Physical Interaction Prediction Network (PIPN), derived from large model knowledge distillation, to generate this representation; and (2) a Hamiltonian Energy Network (HEN) controller, based on energy conservation, to precisely translate this representation into coordinated actions. Experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, PIPHEN can compress the information representation to less than 5% of the original data volume and reduce collaborative decision-making latency from 315ms to 76ms, while significantly improving task success rates.

In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa DynaMimicGen (D-MG)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6700\u5c11\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "D-MG \u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6765\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u6f14\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u539f\u8bed\uff08DMP\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f14\u793a\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e D-MG \u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5806\u53e0\u548c\u5c06\u676f\u5b50\u653e\u5165\u62bd\u5c49\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaMimicGen (D-MG) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%.

Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u52a8\u7269\u7aa5\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u611f\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u906e\u6321\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5728\u5c0f\u5149\u5708\u548c\u5927\u666f\u6df1\u4e0b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u7aa5\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bbd\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6781\u6d45\u666f\u6df1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u7aa5\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u6210\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u5f0f\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, prior works typically focused on body behavior, neglecting the crucial role of eye gaze and its synergy with body motion. We present GazeInterpreter - a novel large language model-based (LLM-based) approach that parses eye gaze data to generate eye-body-coordinated narrations. Specifically, our method features 1) a symbolic gaze parser that translates raw gaze signals into symbolic gaze events; 2) a hierarchical structure that first uses an LLM to generate eye gaze narration at semantic level and then integrates gaze with body motion within the same observation window to produce integrated narration; and 3) a self-correcting loop that iteratively refines the modality match, temporal coherence, and completeness of the integrated narration. This hierarchical and iterative processing can effectively align physical values and semantic text in the temporal and spatial domains. We validated the effectiveness of our eye-body-coordinated narrations on the text-driven motion generation task in the large-scale Nymeria benchmark. Moreover, we report significant performance improvements for the sample downstream tasks of action anticipation and behavior summarization.

Inducing kinesthetic perception through wearable haptic devices has attracted attention, and various devices have been developed in the past. However, these have been limited to verifications on single body parts, and few have applied the same method to multiple body parts as well. In our previous study, we developed a technology that uses the contraction of artificial muscles to deform clothing in three dimensions. Using this technology, we developed a haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception of 7 motions in multiple upper body. However, perceptual mixing caused by stimulating multiple human muscles has occurred between the shoulder and the elbow. In this paper, we established a new, simplified design policy and developed a novel haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perceptions in the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist by stimulating joints and muscles independently. We experimentally demonstrated the induced kinesthetic perception and examined the relationship between stimulation and perceived kinesthetic perception under the new design policy. Experiments confirmed that Funabot-Upper successfully induces kinesthetic perception across multiple joints while reducing perceptual mixing observed in previous designs. The new suit improved recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit, demonstrating its superiority and potential for future haptic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u6b3e\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u670dFunabot-Upper\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u523a\u6fc0\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0a\u80a2\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81f394.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u90e8\u4f4d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u8bbe\u5907\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u8282\u548c\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u679c\u548c\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "Funabot-Upper\u6210\u529f\u8bf1\u53d1\u591a\u5173\u8282\u7684\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fc7\u5f80\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "conclusion": "Funabot-Upper\u5728\u591a\u5173\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Predictive maintenance systems powered by supervised machine learning offer a promising approach by detecting failures before they occur, reducing unscheduled downtime, and improving operational efficiency. However, the success of such systems depends on high quality labeled data, necessitating user centered labeling interfaces tailored to annotators needs for Usability and User Experience. This study introduces a cost effective predictive maintenance system developed in the federally funded project DigiOnTrack, which combines structure borne noise measurement with supervised learning to provide monitoring and maintenance recommendations for rail vehicles and infrastructure in rural Germany. The system integrates wireless sensor networks, distributed ledger technology for secure data transfer, and a dockerized container infrastructure hosting the labeling interface and dashboard. Train drivers and workshop foremen labeled faults on infrastructure and vehicles to ensure accurate recommendations. The Usability and User Experience evaluation showed that the locomotive drivers interface achieved Excellent Usability, while the workshop foremans interface was rated as Good.

However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network.

This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties.

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field.

In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme.

This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties.

Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent.

This paper introduces SEG (\\textit{\\underline{S}upport-\\underline{E}ffective \\underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time. We demonstrate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val, showing that SEG significantly outperforms baseline models such as TRELLIS, DPO, and DRO in terms of support volume reduction and printability. Qualitative results further reveal that SEG maintains high fidelity to input prompts while minimizing the need for support structures.

While current VLA models have shown the strong effectiveness of large-scale real-robot pre-training, synthetic data has not previously demonstrated comparable capability at scale. This paper provides the first evidence that synthetic data alone can match the performance of the strongest $\u03c0$-dataset in pre-training a VLA model, revealing the substantial value of large-scale simulation. The resulting model also exhibits surprisingly zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on several challenging tasks. Our synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, contains over 630k trajectories and 7,433 hours across 4 embodiments, 18 skills, 70 tasks, and 227 scenes, covering rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid-object manipulation. It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning. Using the same architecture as $\u03c0_0$, we pre-train a model entirely on InternData-A1 and find that it matches the official $\u03c0_0$ across 49 simulation tasks, 5 real-world tasks, and 4 long-horizon dexterous tasks. We release the dataset and will open-source the generation pipeline to broaden access to large-scale robotic data and to lower the barrier to scalable data creation for embodied AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5728Vision-Language-Action\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u96f6-shot\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8Vision-Language-Action\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u586b\u8865\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210InternData-A1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6-shot\u7684\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6InternData-A1\u5305\u542b630k\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fInternData-A1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5339\u654c\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.
