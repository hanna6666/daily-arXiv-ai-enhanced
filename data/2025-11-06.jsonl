Handling this complexity and ensuring\nconsistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a\nstructured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,\nexisting Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique\nchallenges of agricultural applications.\n  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,\nwhich can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of\nautonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core\nelements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured\nmethod for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters\nusing concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model\nderived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process\nlayer to capture dynamic agricultural operations.

From comparing\nthe metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best\nacross all cases.

Through simulation and\nreal-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance\ncontrol in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we\nobserved a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our\nproposed approach compared to admittance control. The video of the experiments\nis available at https://youtu.be/va07Gw6YIog."}

The domain is a simply connected orthogonal\npolygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a\nlimited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile\nintruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard,\neven for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our\nattention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods\nbased on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search.\nMoreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the\nnumber of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the\nsearch process while considering the geometric properties of the connected\northogonal search area."}

This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot\ncollaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks\nabout out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a\nchance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned\ntasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we\npropose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user\nhuman-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,\nconfidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum\nfrom egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space).\nResults showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest\naccuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator\nof deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased\naccuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive\nload remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to\napply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models\nwith robots' vision capabilities."}

Addressing the dual challenges of\nmaintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse\noutdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a\nrobust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented\naccuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an\ninfrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise\nlocation tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications.\nWe employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in\ntangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise\ntrajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for\ntrajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing\nand area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying\nmechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent\nairflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's\ncritical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and\nconsistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's\nrobustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for\nautonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications\nof robotics in creative fields."}

Here,\nthe uncertainty is modeled as some probabilistic knowledge on the semantic\nlabels of the environment. For example, the task is \"first go to region 1, then\ngo to region 2\"; however, the exact locations of regions 1 and 2 are not known\na priori, instead a probabilistic belief is available. We propose a novel\nautomata-theoretic approach, where a special product automaton is constructed\nto capture the uncertainty related to semantic labels, and a reward function is\ndesigned for each edge of this product automaton. The proposed algorithm\nutilizes value iteration for online replanning. We show some theoretical\nresults and present some simulations/experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed approach."}

This work introduces a\nself-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through\ninternal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through\nchambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced\nliquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling\nstable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The\ninternal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping\npressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new\npossibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in\nsoft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific\nsampling and operation in underwater and field environments."}
