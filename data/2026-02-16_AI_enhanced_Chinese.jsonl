Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage. Experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale custom dataset demonstrate that LatentAM attains significantly better feature reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving near-real-time speed (12-35 FPS) on the evaluated datasets.

We present Visual Foresight Planning (ForeAct), a general and efficient planner that guides a VLA step-by-step using imagined future observations and subtask descriptions. With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA. Importantly, state-of-the-art VLAs can integrate our planner seamlessly by simply augmenting their visual inputs, without any architectural modification. The foresight generator is pretrained on over 1 million multi-task, cross-embodiment episodes, enabling it to learn robust embodied dynamics.

However, its high computational cost, dominated by repeated log-determinant evaluations, has limited its use in real-time planning. This letter presents Schur-MI, a Gaussian process (GP) MI formulation that (i) leverages the iterative structure of RIG to precompute and reuse expensive intermediate quantities across planning steps, and (ii) uses a Schur-complement factorization to avoid large determinant computations. Together, these methods reduce the per-evaluation cost of MI from $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{V}|^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{A}|^3)$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ denote the candidate and selected sensing locations, respectively. Experiments on real-world bathymetry datasets show that Schur-MI achieves up to a $12.7\\times$ speedup over the standard MI formulation. Field trials with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) performing adaptive IPP further validate its practicality.

Unlike existing single-turn paradigm, LongNav-R1 reformulates the navigation decision process as a continuous multi-turn conversation between the VLA policy and the embodied environment. This multi-turn RL framework offers two distinct advantages: i) it enables the agent to reason about the causal effects of historical interactions and sequential future outcomes; and ii) it allows the model to learn directly from online interactions, fostering diverse trajectory generation and avoiding the behavioral rigidity often imposed by human demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Horizon-Adaptive Policy Optimization. This mechanism explicitly accounts for varying horizon lengths during advantage estimation, facilitating accurate temporal credit assignment over extended sequences. Consequently, the agent develops diverse navigation behaviors and resists collapse during long-horizon tasks. Experiments on object navigation benchmarks validate the framework's efficacy: With 4,000 rollout trajectories, LongNav-R1 boosts the Qwen3-VL-2B success rate from 64.3% to 73.0%. These results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

A pre-step to this interaction is to select the objects, i.e., multi-object selection, which is enabled through two steps: (1) toggling multi-selection mode -- mode-switching -- and then (2) selecting all the intended objects -- subselection. In extended reality (XR), each step can be performed with the eyes, hands, and voice. To examine how design choices affect user performance, we evaluated four mode-switching (SemiPinch, FullPinch, DoublePinch, and Voice) and three subselection techniques (Gaze+Dwell, Gaze+Pinch, and Gaze+Voice) in a user study.

We present KeySense, a purely software solution that preserves physical keyboard motor skills. KeySense isolates intentional taps from resting-finger noise using cognitive-motor timing patterns, and then uses a fine-tuned LLM decoder to convert the resulting noisy letter sequence into the intended word. In controlled component tests, the decoder substantially outperforms two statistical baselines (top-1 accuracy 84.8% vs 75.7% and 79.3%). A 12-participant study shows clear ergonomic and performance benefits: compared with the conventional hover-style keyboard, users rated KeySense as markedly less physically demanding (NASA-TLX median 1.5 vs 4.0), and after brief practice typed significantly faster (WPM 28.3 vs 26.2, p < 0.01).

Although these platforms are engineered to withstand such conditions, mechanical degradation is inevitable. Structural damage manifests as consistent and notable changes in kinodynamic behavior compared to a healthy vehicle. Given the heterogeneous nature of structural failures, quantifying various damages to inform kinodynamics is challenging. We posit that natural language can describe and thus capture this variety of damages. Therefore, we propose Zero-shot Language Informed Kinodynamics (ZLIK), which employs self-supervised learning to ground semantic information of damage descriptions in kinodynamic behaviors to learn a forward kinodynamics model in a data-driven manner. Using the high-fidelity soft-body physics simulator BeamNG.tech, we collect data from a variety of structurally compromised vehicles.

Although generative AI supports powerful multimodal generation, current cultural applications largely emphasize aesthetic reproduction and struggle to convey the deeper meanings of cultural rituals and social frameworks. Based on embodied cognition, we propose an AI-driven dual-path framework for cultural understanding, which we instantiate through GatheringSense, a literati-gathering experience. We conduct a mixed-methods study (N=48) to compare how AI-generated multimodal content and embodied participation complement each other in supporting the understanding of literati gatherings and fostering cultural resonance. Our results show that AI-generated content effectively improves the readability of cultural symbols and initial emotional attraction, yet limitations in physical coherence and micro-level credibility may affect users' satisfaction. In contrast, embodied experience significantly deepens participants' understanding of ritual rules and social roles, and increases their psychological closeness and presence.

Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBF\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u8bbe\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5efa\u8bbe\u73b0\u573a\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7535\u9524\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cdCBF\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5706\u5f62\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u692d\u5706\u5f62\uff09\u5bf9\u4e00\u8f86\u5355\u8f6e\u8f66\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6df7\u4e71\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u97f3\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

CORTEX integrates a deep-learning perception pipeline with convex-optimisation-based trajectory design and guidance, including reference regeneration and abort-to-safe-orbit logic to recover from large deviations caused by sensor faults and engine failures.\n  CORTEX is validated in high-fidelity software simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The software pipeline (Basilisk) models high-fidelity relative dynamics, realistic thruster execution, perception, and attitude control. Hardware testing uses (i) an optical navigation testbed to assess perception-to-estimation performance and (ii) a planar air-bearing testbed to evaluate the end-to-end guidance loop under representative actuation and subsystem effects.

We found that AR dominates the landscape (73%), focusing primarily on tablets or phones, while VR remains uncommon and typically relies on head mounted displays (HMDs). We integrate these quantitative patterns into a joint risk and attention matrix and an Augmented Human Development (AHD) model that link XR pipeline properties to cognitive load, sensory conflict, and access inequity. Finally, implementing a seven dimension coding scheme on a 0 - 2 scale, we obtain mean scholarly attention scores of 1.56 for pedagogy, 1.04 for privacy (primarily procedural consent), 0.96 for technical reliability, 0.92 for accessibility in low resource contexts, 0.81 for medical and health issues, 0.52 for accessibility for disabilities, and 0.14 for data security practices. This indicates that pedagogy receives the most systematic scrutiny, while data access practices is largely overlooked. We conclude by offering a roadmap for Child-Centered XR that helps HCI researchers and educators move beyond novelty to design systems that are developmentally aligned, secure by default, and accessible to diverse learners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e86111\u9879\u5173\u4e8eXR\u5728\u5b66\u524d\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AR\u6280\u672f\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u513f\u7ae5\u5065\u5eb7\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8XR\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e09\u81f3\u516b\u5c81\u513f\u7ae5\u65e9\u671f\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53ca\u516c\u5e73\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\uff08SoK\uff09\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e86111\u9879\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5173\u6ce8\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bXR\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AR\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\u548c\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u800cVR\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6559\u80b2\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u6700\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u5b9e\u8df5\u5219\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u513f\u7ae5\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684XR\u7814\u53d1\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9HCI\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u8d85\u8d8a\u65b0\u5947\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7b26\u5408\u513f\u7ae5\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u53ef\u4f9b\u591a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (under review)", "summary": "We present a quadrotor dynamics Gaussian Process (GP) with gradient information that achieves real-time inference via state-space partitioning and approximation, and that includes aerodynamic effects using data from mid-fidelity potential flow simulations. While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time. This framework provides an efficient foundation for real-time aerodynamic prediction and control algorithms in complex and unsteady environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6c14\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u533a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u79bb\u7ebf\u77e9\u9635\u9006\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u6355\u6349\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u533a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u533a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u533a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6c14\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We propose a composable, model-free reinforcement learning method that learns a value function and an optimal policy for each individual environment element (e.g., goal or obstacle) and composes them online to achieve goal reaching and collision avoidance. Assuming unknown nonlinear dynamics that evolve in continuous time and are input-affine, we derive a continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function and show that the corresponding advantage function is quadratic in the action and optimal policy. Based on this structure, we introduce a model-free actor-critic algorithm that learns policies and value functions for static or moving obstacles using gradient descent. We then compose multiple reach/avoid models via a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), yielding formal obstacle-avoidance guarantees in terms of value-function level sets, providing a model-free alternative to CLF/CBF-based controllers.

While prior work offers hints of potential connections, we lack a systematic account of whether and how distinct presence dimensions map onto the basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We surveyed 301 social VR users and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. Results show that social presence predicts all three needs, while self-presence predicts competence and relatedness, and spatial presence shows no direct or moderating effects.

Using Ohyay.co as a platform, we compared a normal gallery interface with a scene-based Room-type interface where participants are located in circular arrangement on screen in a social support task, and found that participants allocated attention to the group as a whole, and had pronounced self-awareness in the Room format. We then chose a two-sided topic for discussion in the Gallery interface and the Room interface where participants on each team face-off against each other, and found that they utilized spatial references to orient their allegiances, expressing greater engagement with those farther away in digital space and greater empathy with those closer, in the Room over the Gallery format.

A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that CRAFT consistently improves task success, generalizes to unseen objects and novel task variations, and adapts effectively across diverse VLA architectures, enabling robust and generalizable contact-rich manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRAFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u529b\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u529b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u71b5\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u4f4e\u71b5\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u7684\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "CRAFT\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57f9\u517b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u529b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u529b\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7CRAFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "CRAFT\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5728\u591a\u79cdVLA\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u5316\u3002"}}

However, frequent ESDF updates introduce considerable computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose Eva-Tracker, a visibility-aware trajectory planning framework for aerial tracking that eliminates ESDF updates and incorporates a recovery-capable path generation method for target reacquisition. First, we design a target trajectory prediction method and a visibility-aware initial path generation algorithm that maintain an appropriate observation distance, avoid occlusions, and enable rapid replanning to reacquire the target when it is lost. Then, we propose the Field of View ESDF (FoV-ESDF), a precomputed ESDF tailored to the tracker's field of view, enabling rapid visibility evaluation without requiring updates. Finally, we optimize the trajectory using differentiable FoV-ESDF-based objectives to ensure continuous visibility throughout the tracking process. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust tracking results with lower computational effort than existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, once a device is embedded in its host environment, conventional chamber- and turntable-based antenna measurements are often impractical. This paper presents a hemispherical angular received-power mapping methodology for in-situ EM validation of installed mmWave modules under realistic deployment constraints. The approach samples the accessible half-space around a stationary device-under-test by placing a calibrated receiving probe at prescribed (phi, theta, r) locations using geometry-consistent positioning and quasi-static acquisition. Amplitude-only received-power is recorded using standard RF instrumentation to generate hemispherical angular power maps that capture installation-dependent radiation characteristics. Proof-of-concept measurements on a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate repeatable hemi-spherical mapping with angular trends in good agreement with full-wave simulation, supporting practical on-site characterization of embedded mmWave transmitters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7403\u5f62\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u5df2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b89\u88c5\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5468\u8fb9\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u589e\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u7403\u5f62\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f85\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5907\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u53ef\u63a5\u5165\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6821\u51c6\u63a5\u6536\u63a2\u9488\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff08phi, theta, r\uff09\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6d4b\u5b9a\u548c\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u91c7\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572860GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u5757\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u534a\u7403\u5f62\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce2\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5df2\u5d4c\u5165\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u73b0\u573a\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Positive or negative media framing may shape and shift how individuals evaluate HRC. This study examines how message framing moderates the effects of perceived risks and perceived benefits on overall attributed value. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 1150) were randomly assigned to read either a positively or negatively framed newspaper article in one of three industrial contexts (autonomy, employment, safety) about HRC in production. Subsequently, perceived risks, benefits, and value were measured using reliable and publicly available psychometric scales. Two multiple regressions (one per framing condition) tested for main and interaction effects. Framing influenced absolute evaluations of risk, benefits, and value. In both frames, risks and benefits significantly predicted attributed value. Under positive framing, only main effects were observed (risks: beta = -0.52; benefits: beta = 0.45). Under negative framing, both predictors had stronger main effects (risks: beta = -0.69; benefits: beta = 0.63) along with a significant negative interaction (beta = -0.32), indicating that higher perceived risk diminishes the positive effect of perceived benefits. Model fit was higher for the positive frame (R^2 = 0.715) than for the negative frame (R^2 = 0.583), indicating greater explained variance in value attributions. Framing shapes the absolute evaluation of HRC and how risks and benefits are cognitively integrated in trade-offs. Negative framing produces stronger but interdependent effects, whereas positive framing supports additive evaluations. These findings highlight the role of strategic communication in fostering acceptance of HRC and underscore the need to consider framing in future HRC research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u6574\u5408\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8d1f\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4e1a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff08HRC\uff09\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u53d7\u5230\u5458\u5de5\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d1150\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9605\u8bfb\u4e0d\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u62a5\u7eb8\u6587\u7ae0\uff08\u6b63\u9762\u6216\u8d1f\u9762\uff09\u6765\u8003\u5bdf\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u5bf9\u4ef7\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u5f71\u54cd\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6b63\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u4ec5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e3b\u8981\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8d1f\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u5219\u5448\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8d1f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u5f71\u54cdHRC\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u8d1f\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u4f46\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u6b63\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u52a0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u672a\u6765HRC\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9700\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions.

However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \\underline{\\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \\underline{\\textit{Co}}-training \\modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $\u03c0_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $\u03c0_{0.5}$.

However, in scenarios requiring precise contact reasoning, such as robotic manipulation in highly cluttered environments, geometric fidelity alone is insufficient. Standard perception pipelines often neglect physical constraints, resulting in invalid states, e.g., floating objects or severe inter-penetration, rendering downstream simulation unreliable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel physics-constrained Real-to-Sim pipeline that reconstructs physically consistent 3D scenes from single-view RGB-D data. Central to our approach is a differentiable optimization pipeline that explicitly models spatial dependencies via a contact graph, jointly refining object poses and physical properties through differentiable rigid-body simulation. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our reconstructed scenes achieve high physical fidelity and faithfully replicate real-world contact dynamics, enabling stable and reliable contact-rich manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7 RGB-D \u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4 3D \u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e38\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6548\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u60ac\u6d6e\u7269\u4f53\u6216\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u6e17\u900f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u540e\u7eed\u4eff\u771f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f Real-to-Sim \u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u89c6\u56fe RGB-D \u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684 3D \u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u521a\u4f53\u4eff\u771f\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u771f\u5b9e\u518d\u73b0\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u771f\u5b9e\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

The aim is to assess how imaging modality influences user performance, usability, and trust during AR-assisted spinal procedures.\n  Methods: Both imaging systems were integrated into an AR framework, enabling in situ visualization and trajectory guidance. The ultrasound-based workflow combined AR-guided robotic scanning, probabilistic shape completion, and AR visualization. The CBCT-based workflow used AR-assisted scan volume planning, CBCT acquisition, and AR visualization. A between-subject user study was conducted and evaluated in two phases: (1) planning and image acquisition, and (2) needle insertion.\n  Results: Planning time was significantly shorter with the CBCT-based workflow, while SUS, SEQ, and NASA-TLX were comparable between modalities. In the needle insertion phase, the CBCT-based workflow yielded marginally faster insertion times, lower placement error, and better subjective ratings with higher Trust. The ultrasound-based workflow achieved adequate accuracy for facet joint insertion, but showed larger errors for lumbar puncture, where reconstructions depended more heavily on shape completion.\n  Conclusion: The findings indicate that both AR-guided imaging pipelines are viable for spinal intervention support. CBCT-based AR offers advantages in efficiency, precision, usability, and user confidence during insertion, whereas ultrasound-based AR provides adaptive, radiation-free imaging but is limited by shape completion in deeper spinal regions. These complementary characteristics motivate hybrid AR guidance that uses CBCT for global anatomical context and planning, augmented by ultrasound for adaptive intraoperative updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u548cCBCT\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6210\u50cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u810a\u67f1\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aCBCT\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u58f0\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u65e0\u8f90\u5c04\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408AR\u5f15\u5bfc\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9525\u675f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\uff08CBCT\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08AR\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u6210\u50cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u73b0\u573a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002\u8d85\u58f0\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86AR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u548cAR\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002CBCT\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f7f\u7528AR\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u626b\u63cf\u4f53\u79ef\u89c4\u5212\u3001CBCT\u91c7\u96c6\u548cAR\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u7ec4\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u548c\uff082\uff09\u9488\u63d2\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u5728CBCT\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u77ed\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0bSUS\u3001SEQ\u548cNASA-TLX\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ea6\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002\u5728\u9488\u63d2\u5165\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cCBCT\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7565\u5feb\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u653e\u7f6e\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8d85\u58f0\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u5173\u8282\u63d2\u5165\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8170\u690e\u7a7f\u523a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u91cd\u5efa\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08AR\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u90fd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u810a\u67f1\u5e72\u9884\u652f\u6301\u3002CBCT\u57fa\u7840\u7684AR\u5728\u63d2\u9488\u65f6\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u58f0\u57fa\u7840\u7684AR\u63d0\u4f9b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u8f90\u5c04\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f83\u6df1\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u533a\u57df\u53d7\u5230\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u6027\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u6df7\u5408AR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CBCT\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u5256\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u8d85\u58f0\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u672f\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

In particular, while low-level motion tracking and trajectory-following controllers are mature, whole-body reference-guided methods are difficult to adapt to higher-level command interfaces and diverse task contexts: they require large, high-quality datasets, are brittle across speed and pose regimes, and are sensitive to robot-specific calibration. To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with High-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer.

On the one hand, they might motivate users to pursue personal goals, such as healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, they are associated with potential risks like manipulation and deception, which are induced by limited control over probabilistic agent outputs. However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness. Contextual knowledge about physiotherapy benefits did not significantly impact persuasiveness, possibly because the LLM had inherent knowledge about such benefits even without explicit prompting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of empirically studying behavioral patterns of GSAs, specifically in terms of what information generative AI systems require for consistent and responsible communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5176\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8bf4\u670d\u7528\u6237\u8fbe\u6210\u4e2a\u4eba\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5065\u5eb7\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u6b3a\u9a97\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9ChatGPT\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u811a\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684GSA\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u679c\u65ad\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u6027\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u804c\u4e1a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u672a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u4ee3\u7406\uff08GSA\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u53ef\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

Here, \"tool\" denotes a coordination abstraction, not a reduction of human authority or responsibility. Building on LLM-based agent architectures, we operationalize Human Tool by modeling human contributions through structured tool schemas of capabilities, information, and authority. These schemas enable agents to dynamically invoke human input based on relative strengths and reintegrate it through efficient, natural interaction protocols. We validate the framework through controlled studies in both decision-making and creative tasks, demonstrating improved task performance, reduced human workload, and more balanced collaboration dynamics compared to baseline systems.

This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning.

Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

Traditional fuzzy PID tuning often relies on empirical methods, making it difficult to achieve a stable and reproducible equilibrium solution between performance enhancement and control cost. This paper proposes a constrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for tuning six-parameter fuzzy PID controllers. By adjusting the benchmark PID parameters alongside the fuzzy controller's input quantization factor and output proportional gain, it achieves synergistic optimization of the overall tuning strength and dynamic response characteristics of the fuzzy PID system. To ensure engineering feasibility of the optimization results, a time-weighted absolute error integral, adjustment time, relative overshoot control energy, and saturation occupancy rate are introduced. Control energy constraints are applied to construct a constraint-driven comprehensive evaluation system, suppressing pseudo-improvements achieved solely by increasing control inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that, while maintaining consistent control energy and saturation levels, the proposed method significantly enhances deep tracking performance: the time-weighted absolute error integral decreases from 0.2631 to 0.1473, the settling time shortens from 2.301 s to 1.613 s, and the relative overshoot reduces from 0.1494 to 0.01839. Control energy varied from 7980 to 7935, satisfying the energy constraint, while saturation occupancy decreased from 0.004 to 0.003.

Conventional quadrupedal navigation typically separates motion planning from locomotion control, neglecting whole-body constraints and terrain awareness. On the other hand, end-to-end methods are more integrated but require high-frequency sensing, which is often noisy and computationally costly. In addition, most existing approaches assume static environments, limiting their use in human-populated settings. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage training framework with three DRL pipelines. (1) TRANS-Loco employs an asymmetric actor-critic (AC) model for quadrupedal locomotion, enabling traversal of uneven terrains without explicit terrain or contact observations. (2) TRANS-Nav applies a symmetric AC framework for social navigation, directly mapping transformed LiDAR data to ego-agent actions under differential-drive kinematics. (3) A unified pipeline, TRANS, integrates TRANS-Loco and TRANS-Nav, supporting terrain-aware quadrupedal navigation in uneven and socially interactive environments. Comprehensive benchmarks against locomotion and social navigation baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of TRANS.

The generative process is difficult to control and unpredictable, and user instructions may be ambiguous or under-specified.

We present APPO, a preference-guided prompt optimization algorithm. Instead of iterating prompts, users only provide binary preferential feedback. APPO adaptively balances its strategies between exploiting user feedback and exploring new directions, yielding effective and efficient optimization. We evaluate APPO on image generation, and the results show APPO enables achieving satisfactory outcomes in fewer iterations with lower cognitive load than manual prompt editing.

We evaluate Real2Gen on human demonstrations from three different real-world tasks and compare it to a recent baseline. Real2Gen shows an average increase in the success rate of 26.6% and better generalization of the trained policy due to the abundance and diversity of training data.

In this paper, we visually present our experience of a two-and-a-half-year co-design project with the local arts community. Focusing on facilitating community exploration and sense-making around arts funding distribution, the project involved a series of co-design sessions between visualization researchers and members of the arts community. Through these iterative sessions, we built shared understanding and developed visualization prototypes tailored to community needs.

When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions.

However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments.

We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Legato \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5757\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca RTC \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Legato \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u6b65\u6307\u5bfc\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "Legato \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5207\u6362\u548c\u72b9\u8c6b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u6bd4 RTC \u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7ea6 10%\u3002", "conclusion": "Legato \u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5207\u6362\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours. We select swarm feature sets and similarity measures from prior swarm robotics works, which mainly considered a narrow behavioural context and assess their robustness.

In this paper, we present a learning-based control framework for a pneumatically actuated soft quadruped equipped with tactile suction-cup feet, and we validate the approach experimentally on physical hardware. The control policy is trained in simulation through a staged learning process that starts from a reference gait and is progressively refined under randomized environmental conditions. The resulting controller maps proprioceptive and tactile feedback to coordinated pneumatic actuation and suction-cup commands, enabling closed-loop locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces. When deployed on the real robot, the closed-loop policy outperforms an open-loop baseline, increasing forward speed by 41% on a flat surface and by 91% on a 5-degree incline.

However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784TSEASL\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d8a\u91ce\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8d8a\u91ce\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6240\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5e38\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u79fb\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u4fee\u8ba2\u6700\u4f73\u8def\u7ebf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u57df\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u683c\uff08TSEASL\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u884cTSEASL\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u6837\u5730\u70b9\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bb0\u5f55\u5230\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5bf9TSEASL\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u4e3b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u901a\u7528\u3002"}}

However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning.

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faPSI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u53d6\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPerceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u914d\u5bf9\u6293\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u4f7f\u7528\u6293\u53d6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "PSI\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
