To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u56fe\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u957f\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u7684MAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u56fe\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u8fb9\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u957f\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u655b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97MAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u56fe\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time.

Radev"], "title": "Modeling multi-agent motion dynamics in immersive rooms", "comment": null, "summary": "Immersive rooms are increasingly popular augmented reality systems that support multi-agent interactions within a virtual world. However, despite extensive content creation and technological developments, insights about perceptually-driven social dynamics, such as the complex movement patterns during virtual world navigation, remain largely underexplored. Computational models of motion dynamics can help us understand the underlying mechanism of human interaction in immersive rooms and develop applications that better support spatially distributed interaction. In this work, we propose a new agent-based model of emergent human motion dynamics. The model represents human agents as simple spatial geometries in the room that relocate and reorient themselves based on the salient virtual spatial objects they approach. Agent motion is modeled as an interactive process combining external diffusion-driven influences from the environment with internal self-propelling interactions among agents. Further, we leverage simulation-based inference (SBI) to show that the governing parameters of motion patterns can be estimated from simple observables. Our results indicate that the model successfully captures action-related agent properties but exposes local non-identifiability linked to environmental awareness.

However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we run several experiments in a real-world grocery store with this motion planner on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot executing a grocery fulfillment task, achieving 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u9762\u4e34\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u907f\u969c\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8d85\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u572819\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc72000\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a0.4\u79d2\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe99.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u3002"}}

This paper presents a proactive methodology for systematically exploring psychological risks in simulated human-AI interactions based on documented real-world cases involving AI-induced or AI-exacerbated addiction, anorexia, depression, homicide, psychosis, and suicide. We collected and analyzed 18 reported real-world cases where AI interactions contributed to severe psychological outcomes. From these cases, we developed a process to extract harmful interaction patterns and assess potential risks through 2,160 simulated scenarios using clinical staging models. We tested four major LLMs across multi-turn conversations to identify where psychological risks emerge: which harm domains, conversation stages, and contexts reveal system vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of 157,054 simulated conversation turns, we identify critical gaps in detecting psychological distress, responding appropriately to vulnerable users, and preventing harm escalation. Regression analysis reveals variability across persona types: LLMs tend to perform worse with elderly users but better with low- and middle-income groups compared to high-income groups. Clustering analysis of harmful responses reveals a taxonomy of fifteen distinct failure patterns organized into four categories of AI-enabled harm.

This challenge arises from a combination of underspecified language, imperfect visual data, and deictic gestures, which frequently leads to task failure. Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6Plug-and-Play Clarifier\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u610f\u56fe\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u610f\u56fe\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u6f84\u6e05\u5668\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u6f84\u6e05\u5668\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6f84\u6e05\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u6f84\u6e05\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea630%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b67\u4e49\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data.

Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\\% in accuracy.

In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "EyeAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e53\u4e2a\u773c\u79d1\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u533b\u7597\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u773c\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "EyeAgent\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684DeepSeek-V3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea653\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u773c\u79d1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf/\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "EyeAgent\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u773c\u79d1\u7684\u667a\u80fdAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "EyeAgent\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u773c\u79d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u6670\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniMM-V2X\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniMM-V2X\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-V2X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUniMM-V2X\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad839.7%\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e7.2%\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534733.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "UniMM-V2X\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u66f4\u52a0\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u5f71\u54cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u66f4\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u6027\u5408\u8c0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u52a0\u6df1\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e2a\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u7ecf\u6d4e\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4f17\u591a\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002"}}

Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy.

We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs). This insight provides a new lens for evaluating educational technologies, suggesting that the future of learning tools lies not in simply enriching interaction, but in designing systems that scaffold productive cognitive work by leveraging this student expressiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u754c\u9762\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u6210\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u52a8\u4e0e\u6210\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5bf9\u7167\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff08N=20\uff09\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u754c\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u4e0a\u5e76\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u751f\u8ba4\u77e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Real-world experiments with numerous infrastructure sensors incur high costs and regulatory challenges. Conventional single-host simulators lack the capacity for large-scale urban traffic scenarios. This paper proposes D-AWSIM, a distributed simulator that partitions its workload across multiple machines to support the simulation of extensive sensor deployment and dense traffic environments. A Dynamic Map generation framework on D-AWSIM enables researchers to explore information-sharing strategies without relying on physical testbeds.

Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies.

The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability.

These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model.

However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance.

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos.

Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods.

Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view.

One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation.

In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning.

We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the \"imagined\" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods.

To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance.

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness.

However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \\our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.
