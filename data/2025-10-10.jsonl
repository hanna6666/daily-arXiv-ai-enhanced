When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory\noptimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into\nsub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.\nOptimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing\ncontact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about\nfuture sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging\nto make progress on subsequent sub-tasks.

While ultrasound is the\nfirst-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple\nnon-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not\nvisible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant\nexpertise.

The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous\nmanipulation create a \"reality gap\" that has limited prior work to constrained\nscenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,\nconstrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real\nchallenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in\nsimulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the\nreal world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns\nto bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world\ncollected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The\nmodel is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand\ninteraction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing\nsystem-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each\njoint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net\neffects.
