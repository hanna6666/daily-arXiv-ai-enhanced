Incident commanders must plan, coordinate, and document time-critical operations, while field searchers execute evolving tasks in uncertain environments. With recent advances in technology, ground-robot fleets paired with computer-vision-based situational awareness and LLM-powered interfaces offer the potential to ease these operational burdens. However, no dedicated studies have examined how public safety professionals perceive such technologies or envision their integration into existing practices, risking building technically sophisticated yet impractical solutions. To address this gap, we conducted focus-group sessions with eight police officers across five local departments in Virginia. Our findings show that ground robots could reduce professionals' reliance on paper references, mental calculations, and ad-hoc coordination, alleviating cognitive and physical strain in four key challenge areas: (1) partitioning the workforce across multiple search hypotheses, (2) retaining group awareness and situational awareness, (3) building route planning that fits the lost-person profile, and (4) managing cognitive and physical fatigue under uncertainty. We further identify four design opportunities and requirements for future ground-robot fleet integration in public-safety operations: (1) scalable multi-robot planning and control interfaces, (2) agency-specific route optimization, (3) real-time replanning informed by debrief updates, and (4) vision-assisted cueing that preserves operational trust while reducing cognitive workload. We conclude with design implications for deployable, accountable, and human-centered urban-search support systems"}

Building on this potential, we adopted a ''human-as-the-unit'' perspective and investigated users' cross-context privacy challenges through 12 semi-structured interviews. Results reveal that people rely on ad hoc manual strategies while lacking comprehensive privacy controls, highlighting nine privacy-management challenges across applications, temporal contexts, and relationships. To explore solutions, we generated nine AI agent concepts and evaluated them via a speed-dating survey with 116 US participants. The three highest-ranked concepts were all post-sharing management tools with half or full agent autonomy, with users expressing greater trust in AI accuracy than in their own efforts.

The pursuit of live music agents--intelligent systems supporting real-time music performance and interaction--has captivated researchers across HCI, AI, and computer music for decades, and recent advancements in AI suggest unprecedented opportunities to evolve their design. However, the interdisciplinary nature of music has led to fragmented development across research communities, hindering effective communication and collaborative progress. In this work, we bring together perspectives from these diverse fields to map the current landscape of live music agents. Based on our analysis of 184 systems across both academic literature and video, we develop a comprehensive design space that categorizes dimensions spanning usage contexts, interactions, technologies, and ecosystems. By highlighting trends and gaps in live music agents, our design space offers researchers, designers, and musicians a structured lens to understand existing systems and shape future directions in real-time human-AI music co-creation.

We evaluated the system with 40 participants using PANAS-X surveys, subjective questionnaires, physiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance, pulse rate variability), and semi-structured interviews. Results demonstrate that, compared to a visual-only baseline, squeeze-based interaction significantly enhances positive affect and perceived relaxation. Physiological data further revealed a state of \"active relaxation\", characterized by greater reductions in heart rate and preserved autonomic flexibility (PRV), alongside sustained emotional engagement (GSR).

However, currently, the specific demands that arise while using conversational agents for health information seeking, and the strategies people use to cope with those demands, remain unknown. To address these gaps, we conducted a think-aloud study with 15 participants as they sought health information using our off-the-shelf AI conversational agent.

Current state-of-the-art models address this challenge by using large amounts of training data and test-time samples to build black-box scene representations. In this work, we introduce a differentiable neuro-graphics model that combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to perform zero-shot scene reconstruction and robot grasping without relying on any additional 3D data or test-time samples. Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task. By enabling zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without reliance on extensive datasets or test-time sampling, our approach offers a pathway towards more data efficient, interpretable and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments."}

We interview 18 authors of LLM-integrated system papers on their authoring and reviewing experiences.

Authors perceive that reviewers apply uniquely skeptical and inconsistent standards towards papers that report LLM-integrated systems, and mitigate mistrust by adding technical evaluations, justifying usage, and de-emphasizing LLM presence. Authors' views challenge blanket directives to report all prompts and use open models, arguing that prompt reporting is context-dependent and justifying proprietary model usage despite ethical concerns. Finally, some tensions in peer review appear to stem from clashes between the norms and values of HCI and ML/NLP communities, particularly around what constitutes a contribution and an appropriate level of technical rigor.

It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights. Quantitative experiments in the CARLA simulation environment show that the proposed neuro-symbolic representation and SFOL reward function improved policy robustness and safety-related performance metrics compared to baseline representations and reward formulations across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels. The findings demonstrate that integrating holistic representations and soft reasoning into Reinforcement Learning can support more context-aware and value-aligned decision-making for autonomous driving."}

Following prior work, we conducted a within-subject study with 24 participants performing an ISO 9241-411 pointing task under varifocal and fixed-focal viewing. Overall, varifocal viewing yielded significantly higher performance than the fixed-focal baseline across key interaction metrics, although the magnitude and even the direction of the benefit varied across individuals. In particular, participants' responses exhibited a baseline-dependent pattern, with smaller improvements (or occasional degradation) observed for those with better baseline performance. Our findings suggest that varifocal technology can improve AR pointing performance relative to fixed-focal viewing, while highlighting substantial individual differences that should be considered in design and evaluation."}

The two strategies have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but developing a unified approach to take advantage of both methods has proved challenging. A key challenge faced by optimization approaches is the complicated nonlinear relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector pose. When this must be handled concurrently with additional nonconvex constraints like collision avoidance, optimization IK algorithms may suffer high failure rates. We present a new formulation for optimization IK that uses an analytic IK solution as a change of variables, and is fundamentally easier for optimizers to solve. We test our methodology on three popular solvers, representing three different paradigms for constrained nonlinear optimization. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our new formulation achieves higher success rates than the old formulation and baseline methods across various challenging IK problems, including collision avoidance, grasp selection, and humanoid stability."}

This mismatch means that, instead of empowering freelancers, current generative AI tools could reinforce existing precarity and make freelancer collaboration harder. To investigate how to design generative AI tools to support freelancer collaboration, we conducted co-design sessions with 27 freelancers. A key concern that emerged was the risk of AI systems compromising their creative agency and work identities when collaborating, especially when AI tools could reproduce content without attribution, threatening the authenticity and distinctiveness of their collaborative work. Freelancers proposed \"auxiliary AI\" systems, human-guided tools that support their creative agencies and identities, allowing for flexible freelancer-led collaborations that promote \"productive friction\". Drawing on Marcuse's concept of technological rationality, we argue that freelancers are resisting one-dimensional, efficiency-driven AI, and instead envisioning technologies that preserve their collective creative agencies. We conclude with design recommendations for collaborative generative AI tools for freelancers."}

However, the complexity of agentic behaviors makes these systems difficult to understand. When failures occur, developers often struggle to identify root causes and to determine actionable paths for improvement. Traditional methods that rely on inspecting raw log records are inefficient, given both the large volume and complexity of data. To address this challenge, we propose a framework and an interactive system, DiLLS, designed to reveal and structure the behaviors of multi-agent systems. The key idea is to organize information across three levels of query completion: activities, actions, and operations. By probing the multi-agent system through natural language, DiLLS derives and organizes information about planning and execution into a structured, multi-layered summary. Through a user study, we show that DiLLS significantly improves developers' effectiveness and efficiency in identifying, diagnosing, and understanding failures in LLM-based multi-agent systems."}

Classical boustrophedon lawnmower surveys provide geometric coverage guarantees but can waste effort by oversampling predictable regions. In contrast, informative path planning (IPP) methods leverage spatial correlations to reduce oversampling, yet typically offer no guarantees on reconstruction quality. This paper bridges these approaches by addressing informative path planning with guaranteed estimation uncertainty: computing the shortest path whose measurements ensure that the Gaussian-process (GP) posterior variance -- an intrinsic uncertainty measure that lower-bounds the mean-squared prediction error under the GP model -- falls below a user-specified threshold over the monitoring region.\n  We propose a three-stage approach: (i) learn a GP model from available prior information; (ii) transform the learned GP kernel into binary coverage maps for each candidate sensing location, indicating which locations' uncertainty can be reduced below a specified target; and (iii) plan a near-shortest route whose combined coverage satisfies the global uncertainty constraint. To address heterogeneous phenomena, we incorporate a nonstationary kernel that captures spatially varying correlation structure, and we accommodate non-convex environments with obstacles. Algorithmically, we present methods with provable approximation guarantees for sensing-location selection and for the joint selection-and-routing problem under a travel budget. Experiments on real-world topographic data show that our planners meet the uncertainty target using fewer sensing locations and shorter travel distances than a recent baseline, and field experiments with bathymetry-mapping autonomous surface and underwater vehicles demonstrate real-world feasibility."}

We introduce a computationally efficient method for extracting range estimates from single-beam sonar intensity data, enabling reliable wall detection in noisy and reverberant conditions. A closed-form geometric model leverages the two sonar ranges to estimate the pipe center, and an adaptive, confidence-weighted proportional-derivative (PD) controller maintains alignment during traversal.

Experiments in a submerged 46 cm-diameter pipe using a Blue Robotics BlueROV2 heavy remotely operated vehicle demonstrate stable centering and successful full-pipe traversal despite ambient flow and structural deformations.

Meanwhile, use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots in healthcare is rapidly expanding, with one in five general practitioners using generative AI to assist with tasks such as writing letters. Some studies suggest AI chatbots can outperform human healthcare professionals (HCPs) in empathy, though findings are mixed and lack synthesis.\n  Sources of data: We searched multiple databases for studies comparing AI chatbots using large language models with human HCPs on empathy measures. We assessed risk of bias with ROBINS-I and synthesized findings using random-effects meta-analysis where feasible, whilst avoiding double counting.\n  Areas of agreement: We identified 15 studies (2023-2024). Thirteen studies reported statistically significantly higher empathy ratings for AI, with only two studies situated in dermatology favouring human responses. Of the 15 studies, 13 provided extractable data and were suitable for pooling.

In an initial study of deliberately flawed charts, we test whether agents spontaneously penalise chart junk and misleading encodings without being prompted to look for errors. Using established scales (BeauVis and PREVis), the agent evaluated visualizations containing decorative clutter, manipulated axes, and distorted proportional cues. The ratings of aesthetic appeal and perceived readability often remained relatively high even when graphical integrity was compromised. These results suggest that un-nudged AI agent evaluation may underweight integrity-related defects unless such checks are explicitly elicited."}

Existing approaches suffer from inter-module instability in modular pipelines or conflicting training objectives in end-to-end frameworks. We propose Perception-Action integrated Decision-making (PAiD), a progressive architecture that decomposes soccer skill acquisition into three stages: motion-skill acquisition via human motion tracking, lightweight perception-action integration for positional generalization, and physics-aware sim-to-real transfer. This staged decomposition establishes stable foundational skills, avoids reward conflicts during perception integration, and minimizes sim-to-real gaps. Experiments on the Unitree G1 demonstrate high-fidelity human-like kicking with robust performance under diverse conditions-including static or rolling balls, various positions, and disturbances-while maintaining consistent execution across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our divide-and-conquer strategy advances robust humanoid soccer capabilities and offers a scalable framework for complex embodied skill acquisition.

This research explores what can be learned from the expertise of blind individuals and sighted volunteers to inform the design of multimodal voice agents and address the enduring challenge of proactivity. Drawing on granular analysis of two representative fragments from a larger corpus, we contrast the practices co-produced by an experienced human remote sighted assistant and a blind participant-as they collaborate to find a stain on a blanket over the phone-with those achieved when the same participant worked with a multimodal voice agent on the same task, a few moments earlier. This comparison enables us to specify precisely which fundamental proactive practices the agent did not enact in situ.

Standardized data collection rooms are built to capture multimodal human demonstrations (synchronized 3 RGB-D videos, 11 RGB videos, 29-DoF glove joint angles, and 14-channel tactile signals). Based on these human demonstrations, we introduce a tactile-aware retargeting method that maps human hand states to robot dex-hand states via geometry and force-guided optimization.

Real world experiments have demonstrated: (1) The retargeted dex-hand trajectories achieve an 84\\% success rate across 10 diverse object manipulation tasks.

Although single-task policies still offer competitive performance, VLAs are increasingly able to handle commands and environments unseen in their training set. While generalization in vision and language space is undoubtedly important for robust versatile behaviors, a key meta-skill VLAs need to possess is affordance generalization -- the ability to manipulate new objects with familiar physical features.\n  In this work, we present BusyBox, a physical benchmark for systematic semi-automatic evaluation of VLAs' affordance generalization. BusyBox consists of 6 modules with switches, sliders, wires, buttons, a display, and a dial. The modules can be swapped and rotated to create a multitude of BusyBox variations with different visual appearances but the same set of affordances. We empirically demonstrate that generalization across BusyBox variants is highly challenging even for strong open-weights VLAs such as $π_{0.5}$ and GR00T-N1.6. To encourage the research community to evaluate their own VLAs on BusyBox and to propose new affordance generalization experiments, we have designed BusyBox to be easy to build in most robotics labs. We release the full set of CAD files for 3D-printing its parts as well as a bill of materials for (optionally) assembling its electronics. We also publish a dataset of language-annotated demonstrations that we collected using the common bimanual Mobile Aloha robot on the canonical BusyBox configuration.

Understanding authorship in this context requires examining users' evolving internal states during collaboration, particularly self-efficacy and trust. Yet, the dynamics of these states and their associations with users' prompting strategies and authorship outcomes remain underexplored. We examined these dynamics through a study of 302 participants in LLM-assisted writing, capturing interaction logs and turn-by-turn self-efficacy and trust ratings. Our analysis showed that collaboration generally decreased users' self-efficacy while increasing trust. Participants who lost self-efficacy were more likely to ask the LLM to edit their work directly, whereas those who recovered self-efficacy requested more review and feedback. Furthermore, participants with stable self-efficacy showed higher actual and perceived authorship of the final text. Based on these findings, we propose design implications for understanding and supporting authorship in human-LLM collaboration."}

This is still an open issue for robotic hands because such dexterous manipulation requires distinguishing between tactile sensations generated by their self-contact and those arising from external contact. Otherwise, object/robot breakage happens due to contacts/collisions. Indeed, most approaches ignore self-contact altogether, by constraining motion to avoid/ignore self-tactile information during contact. While this reduces complexity, it also limits generalization to real-world scenarios where self-contact is inevitable. Humans overcome this challenge through self-touch perception, using predictive mechanisms that anticipate the tactile consequences of their own motion, through a principle called sensory attenuation, where the nervous system differentiates predictable self-touch signals, allowing novel object stimuli to stand out as relevant. Deriving from this, we introduce TaSA, a two-phased deep predictive learning framework. In the first phase, TaSA explicitly learns self-touch dynamics, modeling how a robot's own actions generate tactile feedback. In the second phase, this learned model is incorporated into the motion learning phase, to emphasize object contact signals during manipulation. We evaluate TaSA on a set of insertion tasks, which demand fine tactile discrimination: inserting a pencil lead into a mechanical pencil, inserting coins into a slot, and fixing a paper clip onto a sheet of paper, with various orientations, positions, and sizes. Across all tasks, policies trained with TaSA achieve significantly higher success rates than baseline methods, demonstrating that structured tactile perception with self-touch based on sensory attenuation is critical for dexterous robotic manipulation."}

By leveraging the multimodal reasoning abilities of VLLMs, VLN-Pilot interprets free-form natural language instructions and grounds them in visual observations to plan and execute drone trajectories in GPS-denied indoor environments. Unlike traditional rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches, our framework integrates language-driven semantic understanding with visual perception, enabling context-aware, high-level flight behaviors with minimal task-specific engineering. VLN-Pilot supports fully autonomous instruction-following for drones by reasoning about spatial relationships, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic reactivity to unforeseen events. We validate our framework on a custom photorealistic indoor simulation benchmark and demonstrate the ability of the VLLM-driven agent to achieve high success rates on complex instruction-following tasks, including long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Experimental results highlight the promise of replacing remote drone pilots with a language-guided autonomous agent, opening avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs in tasks such as inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring.

While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated. This module enables to classify joint conditions by referring to the actual observations at runtime under real-world conditions. The validation experiments conducted both in real-world and simulation with the humanoid robot TOCABI highlight the applicability of the proposed approach. To our knowledge, this manuscript provides the first learning-based fault-tolerant framework for bipedal locomotion, thereby fostering the development of efficient learning methods in this field."}

A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds."}

This duality becomes critical when the absence of a predominant option among goals leads to indecision, challenging reactive systems to break symmetries without computationally-intense planners. We propose a parsimonious neuromorphic control framework that bridges this gap for vision-guided navigation and tracking. Image pixels from an onboard camera are encoded as inputs to dynamic neuronal populations that directly transform visual target excitation into egocentric motion commands. A dynamic bifurcation mechanism resolves indecision by delaying commitment until a critical point induced by the environmental geometry. Inspired by recently proposed mechanistic models of animal cognition and opinion dynamics, the neuromorphic controller provides real-time autonomy with a minimal computational burden, a small number of interpretable parameters, and can be seamlessly integrated with application-specific image processing pipelines. We validate our approach in simulation environments as well as on an experimental quadrotor platform."}

Prior work has shown that social signals are reliable and useful for error management in constrained interactions, but it is unclear if this holds in the real world - especially with a non-social robot in repeated and group interactions with successive or propagated errors. To explore this, we built a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment ($N = 49$). We found that participants consistently expressed varied social signals in response to errors and other stimuli, particularly during group interactions. Our findings suggest that social signals in the wild are rich (with participants volunteering information about the interaction), but \"noisy.\" We discuss lessons, benefits, and challenges for using social signals in real-world HRI."}

To address this gap, we present AFT-Handover, a framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven affordance reasoning with efficient texture-based affordance transfer to achieve zero-shot, generalizable TOH. Given a novel object-task pair, the method retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences via LLM reasoning, and texturizes affordances for feature-based point cloud transfer. We evaluate AFT-Handover across diverse task-object pairs, showing improved handover success rates and stronger generalization compared to baselines. In a comparative user study, our framework is significantly preferred over the current state-of-the-art, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use. Finally, we demonstrate TOH on legged manipulators, highlighting the potential of our framework for real-world robot-human handovers."}

In this paper, we study the problem of cross-embodiment humanoid control and show that a single policy can robustly generalize across a wide range of humanoid robot designs with one-time training. We introduce XHugWBC, a novel cross-embodiment training framework that enables generalist humanoid control through: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across diverse humanoid robots, and (3) effective policy architectures modeling morphological and dynamical properties. XHugWBC is not tied to any specific robot. Instead, it internalizes a broad distribution of morphological and dynamical characteristics during training. By learning motion priors from diverse randomized embodiments, the policy acquires a strong structural bias that supports zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robots. Experiments on twelve simulated humanoids and seven real-world robots demonstrate the strong generalization and robustness of the resulting universal controller."}

While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation. A hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure (EDS) is introduced, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction fused with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) core for temporal consistency. The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations. Furthermore, the integration of a 3.2 s temporal context reduces mapping drift."}

All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone."}

We present an end-to-end, open toolchain that converts benchtop impact tests into deployable safety governors for drones. First, we describe a compact and replicable impact rig and protocol for capturing force-time profiles across drone classes and contact surfaces. Second, we provide data-driven models that map pre-impact speed to impulse and contact duration, enabling direct computation of speed bounds for a target force limit. Third, we release scripts and a ROS2 node that enforce these bounds online and log compliance, with support for facility-specific policies. We validate the workflow on multiple commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors and representative indoor assets, demonstrating that the derived governors preserve task throughput while meeting force constraints specified by safety stakeholders. Our contribution is a practical bridge from measured impacts to runtime limits, with shareable datasets, code, and a repeatable process that teams can adopt to certify indoor MAV operations near humans."}

By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves physical fidelity in imagination, achieving 33% better performance at maintaining object permanence and 29% better compliance with the laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts. Moreover, experiments show that grounding in contact dynamics also translates to planning. In zero-shot real-robot experiments, VT-WM achieves up to 35% higher success rates, with the largest gains in multi-step, contact-rich tasks. Finally, VT-WM demonstrates significant downstream versatility, effectively adapting its learned contact dynamics to a novel task and achieving reliable planning success with only a limited set of demonstrations."}

Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines.

Incident commanders must plan, coordinate, and document time-critical operations, while field searchers execute evolving tasks in uncertain environments. With recent advances in technology, ground-robot fleets paired with computer-vision-based situational awareness and LLM-powered interfaces offer the potential to ease these operational burdens. However, no dedicated studies have examined how public safety professionals perceive such technologies or envision their integration into existing practices, risking building technically sophisticated yet impractical solutions. To address this gap, we conducted focus-group sessions with eight police officers across five local departments in Virginia. Our findings show that ground robots could reduce professionals' reliance on paper references, mental calculations, and ad-hoc coordination, alleviating cognitive and physical strain in four key challenge areas: (1) partitioning the workforce across multiple search hypotheses, (2) retaining group awareness and situational awareness, (3) building route planning that fits the lost-person profile, and (4) managing cognitive and physical fatigue under uncertainty. We further identify four design opportunities and requirements for future ground-robot fleet integration in public-safety operations: (1) scalable multi-robot planning and control interfaces, (2) agency-specific route optimization, (3) real-time replanning informed by debrief updates, and (4) vision-assisted cueing that preserves operational trust while reducing cognitive workload. We conclude with design implications for deployable, accountable, and human-centered urban-search support systems"}
