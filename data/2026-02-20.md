### [1] [Exploring the Design and Impact of Interactive Worked Examples for Learners with Varying Prior Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16806)
*Sutapa Dey Tithi,Xiaoyi Tian,Ally Limke,Min Chi,Tiffany Barnes*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究设计了两种新的实例类型以改善学习效果，结果显示根据学习者的知识水平，针对性的干预能显著提高学习成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过设计不同类型的实例来改善学习效果，特别是考虑到学习者的不同知识水平。

Method: 在控制实验中对155名本科生进行测试，设计了两种新类型的示例：Buggy（修复错误）和Guided（补全规则），并观察其对学习效果的影响。

Result: 参与Buggy和Guided示例组的学生在后测中表现显著优于接受被动示例的学生。Buggy问题对高知识水平的学习者帮助更大，而Guided问题则对低知识水平的学习者更有利。

Conclusion: 研究为逻辑问题解决中的干预设计提供了贡献，特别是针对不同学习者知识水平的干预，同时也展示了行为分析在比较学习者与辅导员互动中的新应用。

Abstract: Tutoring systems improve learning through tailored interventions, such as worked examples, but often suffer from the aptitude-treatment interaction effect where low prior knowledge learners benefit more. We applied the ICAP learning theory to design two new types of worked examples, Buggy (students fix bugs), and Guided (students complete missing rules), requiring varying levels of cognitive engagement, and investigated their impact on learning in a controlled experiment with 155 undergraduate students in a logic problem solving tutor. Students in the Buggy and Guided examples groups performed significantly better on the posttest than those receiving passive worked examples. Buggy problems helped high prior knowledge learners whereas Guided problems helped low prior knowledge learners. Behavior analysis showed that Buggy produced more exploration-revision cycles, while Guided led to more help-seeking and fewer errors. This research contributes to the design of interventions in logic problem solving for varied levels of learner knowledge and a novel application of behavior analysis to compare learner interactions with the tutor.

### [2] [AI-Mediated Feedback Improves Student Revisions: A Randomized Trial with FeedbackWriter in a Large Undergraduate Course](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16820)
*Xinyi Lu,Kexin Phyllis Ju,Mitchell Dudley,Larissa Sano,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究表明，AI中介的反馈能有效提升学生论文修订质量，尤其当教师助理采纳更多AI建议时效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对使用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成学生写作反馈的兴趣增加，尚缺乏对AI与人工反馈对学生反应的比较研究。

Method: 通过在一门大型经济学入门课程中进行随机对照试验，引入FeedbackWriter系统，为教师助理提供AI建议，从而对学生的知识密集型论文提供反馈。

Result: 学生接受AI中介的反馈后，修订的论文质量显著提高，且当教师助理（TAs）采纳更多的AI建议时，质量提升幅度逐渐增加。

Conclusion: AI提供的建议对于提高学生写作论文的质量具有积极影响，而教师助理通过这些建议能够更好地发现问题和澄清评分标准。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in using LLMs to generate feedback on students' writing, little is known about how students respond to AI-mediated versus human-provided feedback. We address this gap through a randomized controlled trial in a large introductory economics course (N=354), where we introduce and deploy FeedbackWriter - a system that generates AI suggestions to teaching assistants (TAs) while they provide feedback on students' knowledge-intensive essays. TAs have the full capacity to adopt, edit, or dismiss the suggestions. Students were randomly assigned to receive either handwritten feedback from TAs (baseline) or AI-mediated feedback where TAs received suggestions from FeedbackWriter. Students revise their drafts based on the feedback, which is further graded. In total, 1,366 essays were graded using the system. We found that students receiving AI-mediated feedback produced significantly higher-quality revisions, with gains increasing as TAs adopted more AI suggestions. TAs found the AI suggestions useful for spotting gaps and clarifying rubrics.

### [3] [Overseeing Agents Without Constant Oversight: Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16844)
*Madeleine Grunde-McLaughlin,Hussein Mozannar,Maya Murad,Jingya Chen,Saleema Amershi,Adam Fourney*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了代理人工智能系统的推理记录在人工监管中的重要性，分析了现有方法的不足和新设计带来的改进，尽管提高了用户信心，但未有效提升决策准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保人工智能系统在智能决策中能够被人类监督，提供合理的推理和行动步骤的记录。

Method: 通过三项用户研究，探讨基本行动记录的实用性，并通过设计探针探讨三种替代方案，测试一种新接口在问题回答任务中对错误发现的影响。

Result: 发现当前的做法笨拙，影响了其有效性，然而，提出的设计减少了参与者发现错误的时间。虽然参与者对于决定的信心提高，但最终准确性并没有显著改善。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了人类验证代理系统面临的挑战，包括管理固有假设、用户主观和变化的正确性标准，以及在沟通代理过程中的短板和重要性。

Abstract: To enable human oversight, agentic AI systems often provide a trace of reasoning and action steps. Designing traces to have an informative, but not overwhelming, level of detail remains a critical challenge. In three user studies on a Computer User Agent, we investigate the utility of basic action traces for verification, explore three alternatives via design probes, and test a novel interface's impact on error finding in question-answering tasks. As expected, we find that current practices are cumbersome, limiting their efficacy. Conversely, our proposed design reduced the time participants spent finding errors. However, although participants reported higher levels of confidence in their decisions, their final accuracy was not meaningfully improved. To this end, our study surfaces challenges for human verification of agentic systems, including managing built-in assumptions, users' subjective and changing correctness criteria, and the shortcomings, yet importance, of communicating the agent's process.

*Inha Cha,Yeonju Jang,Haesoo Kim,Joo Young Park,Seora Park,EunJeong Cheon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本论文分析了韩国数字性暴力的四个时代，探讨了不同技术和立法背景下性别歧视的重新构建及其对受害者的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网科技的发展，韩国的数字性暴力问题愈发严重，引起了公众的广泛关注，因此有必要对其演变及影响进行深入研究。

Method: 采用基因谱方法，分析不同年代的DSV突发事件，结合媒体报道、法律文件和学术文献进行综合研究。

Result: 本研究揭示了韩国数字性暴力（DSV）在多个时代的演变及其特征，从1990年代初期互联网时代到2020年代中期的深度伪造丑闻，分析了相关的法律、媒体和学术文献。

Conclusion: 研究识别了DSV的三个相互关联的维度，并建议今后的社区系统计算与工作（CSCW）研究方向，强调了基因谱方法在理解DSV的动态性和复杂性中的重要性。

Abstract: Ever since the introduction of internet technologies in South Korea, digital sexual violence (DSV) has been a persistent and pervasive problem. Evolving alongside digital technologies, the severity and scale of violence have grown consistently, leading to widespread public concern. In this paper, we present four eras of image-based DSV in South Korea, spanning from the early internet era of the 1990s to the deepfake scandals in the mid-2020s. Drawing from media coverage, legal documents, and academic literature, we elucidate forms and characteristics of DSV cases in each era, tracing how entrenched misogyny is reconfigured and amplified through evolving technologies, alongside shifting legislative measures. Taking a genealogical approach to read prominent cases of different eras, our analysis identifies three constitutive and interconnected dimensions of DSV: (1) the homo-social fabrication of "obscenity", wherein victims' imagery becomes collectively framed as obscene through participatory practices in male-dominant networks; (2) the increasing imperceptibility of violence, as technologies foreclose victims' ability to perceive harm; and (3) the commercialization of abuse through decentralized economic infrastructures. We suggest future directions for CSCW research, and further reflect on the value of the genealogical method in enabling non-linear understanding of DSV as dynamically evolving sociotechnical configurations of harm.

### [5] [CalmReminder: A Design Probe for Parental Engagement with Children with Hyperactivity, Augmented by Real-Time Motion Sensing with a Watch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16893)
*Riku Arakawa,Shreya Bali,Anupama Sitaraman,Woosuk Seo,Sam Shaaban,Oliver Lindheim,Traci M. Kennedy,Mayank Goel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了CalmReminder系统，该系统旨在通过检测儿童的平静时刻，向家长发送时机合适的提示。研究表明，家长能够以灵活多样的方式应用通知，从而改善亲子互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭在养育有ADHD儿童时常面临较大压力，而数字干预措施需要更个性化，以反映家长的真实育儿实践。

Method: 通过四周的实地部署测试CalmReminder系统，招募了16个ADHD儿童的家庭，比较了不同的通知策略。

Result: 本研究展示了一种名为CalmReminder的手表系统，该系统能够检测儿童的平静时刻，并在适当时刻向家长发送提示，帮助家长在与有注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）的孩子的互动中降低压力并改进育儿方式。

Conclusion: 家长不仅是被动接受者，而是积极的设计者，能够根据自己的育儿风格灵活调整干预措施。

Abstract: Families raising children with ADHD often experience heightened stress and reactive parenting. While digital interventions promise personalization, many remain one-size-fits-all and fail to reflect parents' lived practices. We present CalmReminder, a watch-based system that detects children's calm moments and delivers just-in-time prompts to parents. Through a four-week deployment with 16 families (twelve completed) of children with ADHD, we compared notification strategies ranging from hourly to random to only when the child was inferred to be calm. Our sensing-based notifications were frequently perceived as arriving during calm moments. More importantly, parents adopted the system in diverse ways: using notifications for praise, mindfulness, activity planning, or conversation. These findings show that parents are not passive recipients but active designers, reshaping interventions to fit their parenting styles. We contribute a calm detection pipeline, empirical insights into families' flexible appropriation of notifications, and design implications for intervention systems that foster agency.

### [6] [Connecting the Dots: Surfacing Structure in Documents through AI-Generated Cross-Modal Links](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16895)
*Alyssa Hwang,Hita Kambhamettu,Yue Yang,Ajay Patel,Joseph Chee Chang,Andrew Head*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种框架，旨在帮助读者更好地理解信息密集的文档，实验结果表明使用该框架的工具可以提高理解力，同时保持低认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多信息密集的文档，如食谱和科学论文，要求读者在文本、图形、表格等视觉元素中找到、解释和连接细节，这对理解复杂材料提出了巨大挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一个用于复杂文档信息细粒度集成的框架，并在一个增强阅读界面中实施，用户可以通过可点击的图形点、互动文本高亮和持久参考面板来浏览文档。

Result: 通过一项控制实验，我们发现使用该工具的参与者在阅读测验中得分显著提高，且没有显示出增加的完成时间或认知负担。

Conclusion: 细粒度集成为揭示文档内关系提供了一种系统的方法，支持对复杂信息密集材料的更好理解和参与。

Abstract: Understanding information-dense documents like recipes and scientific papers requires readers to find, interpret, and connect details scattered across text, figures, tables, and other visual elements. These documents are often long and filled with specialized terminology, hindering the ability to locate relevant information or piece together related ideas. Existing tools offer limited support for synthesizing information across media types. As a result, understanding complex material remains cognitively demanding. This paper presents a framework for fine-grained integration of information in complex documents. We instantiate the framework in an augmented reading interface, which populates a scientific paper with clickable points on figures, interactive highlights in the body text, and a persistent reference panel for accessing consolidated details without manual scrolling. In a controlled between-subjects study, we find that participants who read the paper with our tool achieved significantly higher scores on a reading quiz without evidence of increased time to completion or cognitive load. Fine-grained integration provides a systematic way of revealing relationships within a document, supporting engagement with complex, information-dense materials.

### [7] [Evidotes: Integrating Scientific Evidence and Anecdotes to Support Uncertainties Triggered by Peer Health Posts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16900)
*Shreya Bali,Riku Arakawa,Peace Odiase,Tongshuang Wu,Mayank Goel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Evidotes是一个信息支持系统，通过三种可选视角增强用户健康帖子的信息，提高了用户的信息满意度并降低了情感成本，促进了科学证据与人类轶事之间的有效整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注于提升信息的相关性和准确性，但未能满足用户多样的信息需求和情感触动。

Method: 提出Evidotes信息支持系统，通过三种用户可选视角增强帖子信息，进行混合方法研究。

Result: 在与17名慢性病患者的研究中，Evidotes显著提高了自报的信息满意度（从3.2提升至4.6），情感成本降低（从3.4降至1.9）。

Conclusion: Evidotes有效整合科学证据与人类轶事，帮助用户更好地管理健康不确定性。

Abstract: Peer health posts surface new uncertainties, such as questions and concerns for readers. Prior work focused primarily on improving relevance and accuracy fails to address users' diverse information needs and emotions triggered. Instead, we propose directly addressing these by information augmentation. We introduce Evidotes, an information support system that augments individual posts with relevant scientific and anecdotal information retrieved using three user-selectable lenses (dive deeper, focus on positivity, and big picture). In a mixed-methods study with 17 chronic illness patients, Evidotes improved self-reported information satisfaction (3.2->4.6) and reduced self-reported emotional cost (3.4->1.9) compared to participants' baseline browsing. Moreover, by co-presenting sources, Evidotes unlocked information symbiosis: anecdotes made research accessible and contextual, while research helped filter and generalize peer stories. Our work enables an effective integration of scientific evidence and human anecdotes to help users better manage health uncertainty.

### [8] [Say It My Way: Exploring Control in Conversational Visual Question Answering with Blind Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16930)
*Farnaz Zamiri Zeraati,Yang Trista Cao,Yuehan Qiao,Hal Daumé,Hernisa Kacorri*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了如何让盲用户自定义其与视觉问答系统的交互，以提高其可用性，发现提示工程等个性化技术能够改善系统响应的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过增强用户控制和定制交互模式改善助力视觉问答工具的用户体验，尤其是对盲人的影响。

Method: 邀请11名盲用户自定义与现实世界对话式视觉问答系统的交互，分析他们所采用的基于提示的技术。

Result: 基于418次交互结果、反思及后期访谈的分析，发现盲用户的交互往往冗长，平均3轮，有时多达21轮，输入文本通常比他们听到的回复短十倍。

Conclusion: 提出个性化技术如提示工程可以帮助用户克服系统的不足，并提供了一个新的公开数据集以支持交互设计的深入研究。

Abstract: Prompting and steering techniques are well established in general-purpose generative AI, yet assistive visual question answering (VQA) tools for blind users still follow rigid interaction patterns with limited opportunities for customization. User control can be helpful when system responses are misaligned with their goals and contexts, a gap that becomes especially consequential for blind users that may rely on these systems for access. We invite 11 blind users to customize their interactions with a real-world conversational VQA system. Drawing on 418 interactions, reflections, and post-study interviews, we analyze prompting-based techniques participants adopted, including those introduced in the study and those developed independently in real-world settings. VQA interactions were often lengthy: participants averaged 3 turns, sometimes up to 21, with input text typically tenfold shorter than the responses they heard. Built on state-of-the-art LLMs, the system lacked verbosity controls, was limited in estimating distance in space and time, relied on inaccessible image framing, and offered little to no camera guidance. We discuss how customization techniques such as prompt engineering can help participants work around these limitations. Alongside a new publicly available dataset, we offer insights for interaction design at both query and system levels.

*Lev Tankelevitch,Ava Elizabeth Scott,Nagaravind Challakere,Payod Panda,Sean Rintel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过轻量级目标反思干预提高会议有效性，结果显示尽管统计意义不明显，但自我报告的意识和行为有所改善，强调了设计会议意图支持技术的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高会议的有效性，解决当前协作平台缺乏集成支持的问题。

Method: 通过在全球科技公司进行的预注册现场实验，测试轻量级目标反思干预，涉及361名员工和7196次会议。

Result: 虽然干预对会议有效性的影响没有统计显著性，但混合方法的研究发现显示，两个组别在自我报告的意识和行为方面有所改善，后期调查意外地成为了一种干预手段。

Conclusion: 强调支持目标反思的潜力，同时指出评估和支持工作场所会议反思所面临的挑战，并提出为会议意图设计技术支持的相关建议。

Abstract: Ineffective meetings are pervasive. Thinking ahead explicitly about meeting goals may improve effectiveness, but current collaboration platforms lack integrated support. We tested a lightweight goal-reflection intervention in a preregistered field experiment in a global technology company (361 employees, 7196 meetings). Over two weeks, workers in the treatment group completed brief pre-meeting surveys in their collaboration platform, nudging attention to goals for upcoming meetings. To measure impact, both treatment and control groups completed post-meeting surveys about meeting effectiveness. While the intervention impact on meeting effectiveness was not statistically significant, mixed-methods findings revealed improvements in self-reported awareness and behaviour across both groups, with post-meeting surveys unintentionally functioning as an intervention. We highlight the promise of supporting goal reflection, while noting challenges of evaluating and supporting workplace reflection for meetings, including workflow and collaboration norms, and attitudes and behaviours around meeting preparation. We conclude with implications for designing technological support for meeting intentionality.

TL;DR: 研究家庭机器人用户的隐私设计需求，提出可行性设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对家庭机器人的隐私问题关注较少，特别是多用户视角下的隐私设计。

Method: 通过与15个家庭进行面对面的参与式设计会议，探索用户对隐私意识家庭机器人的设计需求。

Result: 参与者普遍不信任机器人或制造商能够保护家庭成员的数据隐私，并提出了设计方案以寻求对数据的控制权。

Conclusion: 提出了有针对性的设计建议，帮助机器人制造商和开发者更好地满足用户的隐私需求。

Abstract: Household robots boasting mobility, more sophisticated sensors, and powerful processing models have become increasingly prevalent in the commercial market. However, these features may expose users to unwanted privacy risks, including unsolicited data collection and unauthorized data sharing. While security and privacy researchers thus far have explored people's privacy concerns around household robots, literature investigating people's preferred privacy designs and mitigation strategies is still limited. Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time. We synthesize our findings into actionable design recommendations for robot manufacturers and developers.

TL;DR: StoryLensEdu是一个多代理系统，通过使用叙事结构生成个性化的学习报告，改善了学习过程中反馈的可解释性和用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化反馈在自我调节学习（SRL）中发挥重要作用，但当前的解决方案在可解释性、呈现方式和可解释性方面存在问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为StoryLensEdu的多代理系统，生成直观、互动的学习报告，整合了数据分析师、教师和讲述者三个角色，使用英雄旅程叙事框架组织见解。

Result: 在真实高中的形成性研究中，StoryLensEdu与电子学习团队协作开发，用户评估表明其提高了用户参与度并促进了对学习过程的深入理解。

Conclusion: StoryLensEdu通过叙事驱动的反馈方式有效增强了学习者的参与感和理解力，解决了当前学习报告的不足之处。

Abstract: Personalized feedback plays an important role in self-regulated learning (SRL), helping students track progress and refine their strategies. However, current common solutions, such as text-based reports or learning analytics dashboards, often suffer from poor interpretability, monotonous presentation, and limited explainability. To overcome these challenges, we present StoryLensEdu, a narrative-driven multi-agent system that automatically generates intuitive, engaging, and interactive learning reports. StoryLensEdu integrates three agents: a Data Analyst that extracts data insights based on a learning objective centered structure, a Teacher that ensures educational relevance and offers actionable suggestions, and a Storyteller that organizes these insights using the Heroes Journey narrative framework. StoryLensEdu supports post-generation interactive question answering to improve explainability and user engagement. We conducted a formative study in a real high school and iteratively developed StoryLensEdu in collaboration with an e-learning team to inform our design. Evaluation with real users shows that StoryLensEdu enhances engagement and promotes a deeper understanding of the learning process.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了Rememo工具，旨在通过生成性人工智能支持回忆治疗，解决治疗师面临的文化挑战，并探讨人类与人工智能在护理工作中的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 促进非药物干预即回忆疗法在痴呆症护理中的有效应用，关注人际关系在治疗过程中的重要性。

Method: 开发了一种名为Rememo的工具，以支持和丰富人类的回忆治疗（RT）介入。

Result: Rememo是一个面向治疗师的工具，整合了生成性人工智能，以支持新加坡治疗师在人际关系和文化挑战中进行个性化的回忆疗法。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了人类与人工智能在护理工作中的协作理解，并呼吁重新思考合成图像作为记忆治疗的支持，而不是事实记录。

Abstract: Reminiscence therapy (RT) is a common non-pharmacological intervention in dementia care. Recent technology-mediated interventions have largely focused on people with dementia through solutions that replace human facilitators with conversational agents. However, the relational work of facilitation is critical in the effectiveness of RT. Hence, we developed Rememo, a therapist-oriented tool that integrates Generative AI to support and enrich human facilitation in RT. Our tool aims to support the infrastructural and cultural challenges that therapists in Singapore face. In this research, we contribute the Rememo system as a therapist's tool for personalized RT developed through sociotechnically-aware research-through-design. Through studying this system in-situ, our research extends our understanding of human-AI collaboration for care work. We discuss the implications of designing AI-enabled systems that respect the relational dynamics in care contexts, and argue for a rethinking of synthetic imagery as a therapeutic support for memory rahter than a record of truth.

Motivation: 本研究旨在填补对视力障碍者与自然关系认识的缺口，探讨他们如何与自然互动及其面临的挑战。

Method: 通过对20名视力障碍者和20名有视力者进行调查，以及对16名视力障碍者进行深入访谈，研究其与自然的互动方式及影响因素。

Result: 该研究发现视力障碍者与自然的相关性水平低于有视力的人，并揭示了他们在与自然互动时的实践、态度和技术期望。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了理解视力障碍者如何超越视觉体验自然的重要性，并为未来的技术设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Nature plays a crucial role in human health and well-being, but little is known about how blind people experience and relate to it. We conducted a survey of nature relatedness with blind (N=20) and sighted (N=20) participants, along with in-depth interviews with 16 blind participants, to examine how blind people engage with nature and the factors shaping this engagement. Our survey results revealed lower levels of nature relatedness among blind participants compared to sighted peers. Our interview study further highlighted: 1) current practices and challenges of nature engagement, 2) attitudes and values that shape engagement, and 3) expectations for assistive technologies that support safe and meaningful engagement. We also provide design implications to guide future technologies that support nature engagement for blind people. Overall, our findings illustrate how blind people experience nature beyond vision and lay a foundation for technologies that support inclusive nature engagement.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了对话代理（CA）的语言表达如何影响用户在慈善捐赠中的决策与感知，发现悲观CA会导致用户情感低落，却可能增加捐款倾向，强调了CA在操控用户决策中的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型驱动的对话代理（CA）如何通过语言传达不同的个性，并探索这种个性对用户决策和感知的影响，特别是在慈善捐赠的背景下。

Method: 在一项众包研究中，360名参与者与八种不同人格的CA互动。这些CA的人格由三种语言特征组成：态度（乐观/悲观）、权威（权威/顺从）和推理（情感/理性）。

Result: 参与者的捐赠决策未受到CA整体人格的影响，但对CA的人格影响了他们的感知和情感反应。特别是，与悲观CA互动的参与者感到较低的情绪状态和对慈善事业的低亲和力，认为CA的可信度和能力较低，但还是更倾向于向慈善机构捐款。

Conclusion: CA作为操控工具的风险突显，能够微妙地影响用户的感知和决策，尤其是在捐赠决策中，信任、能力和情感同理心的感知显著预测了捐赠的决定。

Abstract: Large Language Model-powered conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly capable of projecting sophisticated personalities through language, but how these projections affect users is unclear. We thus examine how CA personalities expressed linguistically affect user decisions and perceptions in the context of charitable giving. In a crowdsourced study, 360 participants interacted with one of eight CAs, each projecting a personality composed of three linguistic aspects: attitude (optimistic/pessimistic), authority (authoritative/submissive), and reasoning (emotional/rational). While the CA's composite personality did not affect participants' decisions, it did affect their perceptions and emotional responses. Particularly, participants interacting with pessimistic CAs felt lower emotional state and lower affinity towards the cause, perceived the CA as less trustworthy and less competent, and yet tended to donate more toward the charity. Perceptions of trust, competence, and situational empathy significantly predicted donation decisions. Our findings emphasize the risks CAs pose as instruments of manipulation, subtly influencing user perceptions and decisions.

TL;DR: 本研究提出NotebookRAG方法，结合用户意图、数据集和现有笔记本，自动生成高质量的探索性数据分析，显著提升了分析效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索性数据分析对数据科学至关重要，但依赖于分析师的专业知识和努力。现有的基于大语言模型的方法在生成有效的分析计划时面临挑战。

Method: NotebookRAG通过将用户意图、数据集和现有笔记本作为输入，检索、增强和重用相关笔记本内容，来实现自动化的探索性数据分析生成。

Result: 用户研究显示，该方法在生成高质量和符合用户意图的EDA笔记本方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: NotebookRAG方法在生成高质量、符合用户意图的探索性数据分析笔记本方面表现优越。

Abstract: High-quality exploratory data analysis (EDA) is essential in the data science pipeline, but remains highly dependent on analysts' expertise and effort. While recent LLM-based approaches partially reduce this burden, they struggle to generate effective analysis plans and appropriate insights and visualizations when user intent is abstract. Meanwhile, a vast collection of analysis notebooks produced across platforms and organizations contains rich analytical knowledge that can potentially guide automated EDA. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a natural way to leverage such corpora, but general methods often treat notebooks as static documents and fail to fully exploit their potential knowledge for automating EDA. To address these limitations, we propose NotebookRAG, a method that takes user intent, datasets, and existing notebooks as input to retrieve, enhance, and reuse relevant notebook content for automated EDA generation. For retrieval, we transform code cells into context-enriched executable components, which improve retrieval quality and enable rerun with new data to generate updated visualizations and reliable insights. For generation, an agent leverages enhanced retrieval content to construct effective EDA plans, derive insights, and produce appropriate visualizations. Evidence from a user study with 24 participants confirms the superiority of our method in producing high-quality and intent-aligned EDA notebooks.

Conclusion: 本研究为优先考虑人际细微差别的AI辅助通信系统提供了设计启示。

Abstract: LLM-assisted writing has seen rapid adoption in interpersonal communication, yet current systems often fail to capture the subtle tones essential for effectiveness. Email writing exemplifies this challenge: effective messages require careful alignment with intent, relationship, and context beyond mere fluency. Through formative studies, we identified three key challenges: articulating nuanced communicative intent, making modifications at multiple levels of granularity, and reusing effective tone strategies across messages. We developed PersonaMail, a system that addresses these gaps through structured communication factor exploration, granular editing controls, and adaptive reuse of successful strategies. Our evaluation compared PersonaMail against standard LLM interfaces, and showed improved efficiency in both immediate and repeated use, alongside higher user satisfaction. We contribute design implications for AI-assisted communication systems that prioritize interpersonal nuance over generic text generation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了AI导师在网络安全教育中的实际应用，发现不同的互动风格与学生的挑战完成情况相关，并提供了针对教育者和开发者的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络安全领域对高素质人才的需求不断上升，急需找到有效的教育方法。考虑到AI导师在编程课程中的潜力，本研究旨在填补AI导师在网络安全教育应用中的空白。

Method: 通过对309名学生在一个学期内与AI导师的互动进行观察和分析，研究其查询模式、会话策略及其与挑战完成的关系。

Result: 本研究通过观察309名学生在一个高级入门网络安全课程中使用嵌入式AI导师的情况，评估了AI导师在网络安全教育中的效果。通过分析142,526条学生向AI导师发送的查询，我们发现学生与AI导师的互动模式和成功完成网络安全挑战的相关性。

Conclusion: 学生对AI导师的使用表现出了不同的会话风格，这些风格与挑战完成情况显著相关。尽管学生对AI导师的价值表示认可，但在学习更难的材料时，其有效性减弱。

Abstract: To meet the ever-increasing demands of the cybersecurity workforce, AI tutors have been proposed for personalized, scalable education. But, while AI tutors have shown promise in introductory programming courses, no work has evaluated their use in hands-on exploration and exploitation of systems (e.g., ``capture-the-flag'') commonly used to teach cybersecurity. Thus, despite growing interest and need, no work has evaluated how students use AI tutors or whether they benefit from their presence in real, large-scale cybersecurity courses. To answer this, we conducted a semester-long observational study on the use of an embedded AI tutor with 309 students in an upper-division introductory cybersecurity course. By analyzing 142,526 student queries sent to the AI tutor across 396 cybersecurity challenges spanning 9 core cybersecurity topics and an accompanying set of post-semester surveys, we find (1) what queries and conversational strategies students use with AI tutors, (2) how these strategies correlate with challenge completion, and (3) students' perceptions of AI tutors in cybersecurity education. In particular, we identify three broad AI tutor conversational styles among users: Short (bounded, few-turn exchanges), Reactive (repeatedly submitting code and errors), and Proactive (driving problem-solving through targeted inquiry). We also find that the use of these styles significantly predicts challenge completion, and that this effect increases as materials become more advanced. Furthermore, students valued the tutor's availability but reported that it became less useful for harder material. Based on this, we provide suggestions for security educators and developers on practical AI tutor use.

Method: 通过自然语言输入，使用大语言模型解析用户意图，生成对应的图形着色器代码，并在增强现实头显中实时编译和展示。

Result: 本文介绍了一个名为ShadAR的增强现实应用程序，旨在通过使用大语言模型（LLMs）实现对视觉感知的实时转变。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) can simulate various visual perceptions, such as how individuals with colorblindness see the world. However, these simulations require developers to predefine each visual effect, limiting flexibility. We present ShadAR, an AR application enabling real-time transformation of visual perception through shader generation using large language models (LLMs). ShadAR allows users to express their visual intent via natural language, which is interpreted by an LLM to generate corresponding shader code. This shader is then compiled real-time to modify the AR headset viewport. We present our LLM-driven shader generation pipeline and demonstrate its ability to transform visual perception for inclusiveness and creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户在与基于大型语言模型的对话代理互动时可能暴露个人数据，因此了解这些模型如何关联特定信息至关重要。

Method: 通过引入LMP2工具，对八个大型语言模型进行了审计，并进行两项用户研究以收集对模型生成个人数据的直觉和对工具输出的反应。

Result: 研究发现，模型能够自信地生成多个个人数据类别，且许多用户对模型生成信息感到担忧。

Conclusion: 大多数参与者希望控制与其姓名关联的模型生成信息，并提出了数据隐私权是否应扩展至大型语言模型的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), and conversational agents based on them, are exposed to personal data (PD) during pre-training and during user interactions. Prior work shows that PD can resurface, yet users lack insight into how strongly models associate specific information to their identity. We audit PD across eight LLMs (3 open-source; 5 API-based, including GPT-4o), introduce LMP2 (Language Model Privacy Probe), a human-centered, privacy-preserving audit tool refined through two formative studies (N=20), and run two studies with EU residents to capture (i) intuitions about LLM-generated PD (N1=155) and (ii) reactions to tool output (N2=303). We show empirically that models confidently generate multiple PD categories for well-known individuals. For everyday users, GPT-4o generates 11 features with 60% or more accuracy (e.g., gender, hair color, languages). Finally, 72% of participants sought control over model-generated associations with their name, raising questions about what counts as PD and whether data privacy rights should extend to LLMs.

Conclusion: 沉浸式虚拟现实环境为早期儿童ADHD的心理运动缺陷提供了一种安全、吸引人和有效的治疗媒介。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality (VR)-based training program in improving body awareness among children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, the research sample consisted of 10 children aged 4 to 7 years, with IQ scores ranging from 90 to 110. Participants were divided into an experimental group and a control group, with the experimental group receiving a structured VR intervention over three months, totaling 36 sessions. Assessment tools included the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (5th Edition), the Conners Test for ADHD, and a researcher-prepared Body Awareness Scale.
  The results indicated statistically significant differences between pre-test and post-test scores for the experimental group, demonstrating the program's efficacy in enhancing spatial awareness, body part identification, and motor expressions. Furthermore, follow-up assessments conducted one month after the intervention revealed no significant differences from the post-test results, confirming the sustainability and continuity of the program's effects over time. The findings suggest that immersive VR environments provide a safe, engaging, and effective therapeutic medium for addressing psychomotor deficits in early childhood ADHD.

Result: 提出了一种自动叉车在倾斜表面上卸货的控制方法，以便在不拖动托盘的情况下拔出叉子。

Conclusion: 通过动态仿真和使用真实叉车的实验验证了该方法的有效性，能有效地进行倾斜卸货。

Abstract: This paper proposes a control method for autonomous forklifts to unload pallets on inclined surfaces, enabling the fork to be withdrawn without dragging the pallets. The proposed method applies the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to point clouds measured from the upper region of the pallet and thereby tracks the relative position and attitude angle difference between the pallet and the fork during the unloading operation in real-time. According to the tracking result, the fork is aligned parallel to the target surface. After the fork is aligned, it is possible to complete the unloading process by withdrawing the fork along the tilt, preventing any dragging of the pallet. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through dynamic simulations and experiments using a real forklift that replicate unloading operations onto the inclined bed of a truck.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，提出的方法在提高精度、减少速度波动及提高计算效率方面具有优势

Abstract: This paper presents a smooth trajectory generation method for a four-degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic milling robot. The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.

Conclusion: RRT$^η$ 框架在保证 RRT$^ullet$ 的概率完整性和渐近最优性的同时，合成符合 STL 规范的动态可行控制序列。

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning has emerged as a powerful approach for robotics, enabling exploration of complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces. When combined with Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a temporal logic widely used for formalizing interpretable robotic tasks, these methods can address complex spatiotemporal constraints. However, traditional approaches rely on min-max robustness measures that focus only on critical time points and subformulae, creating non-smooth optimization landscapes with sharp decision boundaries that hinder efficient tree exploration.
  We propose RRT$^η$, a sampling-based planning framework that integrates the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM) robustness measure to evaluate satisfaction across all time points and subformulae. Our key contributions include: (1) AGM robustness interval semantics for reasoning about partial trajectories during tree construction, (2) an efficient incremental monitoring algorithm computing these intervals, and (3) enhanced Direction of Increasing Satisfaction vectors leveraging Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL) for principled objective composition. Our framework synthesizes dynamically feasible control sequences satisfying STL specifications with high robustness while maintaining the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of RRT$^\ast$. We validate our approach on three robotic systems. A double integrator point robot, a unicycle mobile robot, and a 7-DOF robot arm, demonstrating superior performance over traditional STL robustness-based planners in multi-constraint scenarios with limited guidance signals.

Result: 通过短时音频信号，系统能够估计接触位置和法向力，并检测滑动。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明该系统具有毫米级定位、可靠的力估计和实时滑动检测功能。

Abstract: Distributed tactile sensing remains difficult to scale over large areas: dense sensor arrays increase wiring, cost, and fragility, while many alternatives provide limited coverage or miss fast interaction dynamics. We present Sound of Touch, an active acoustic tactile-sensing methodology that uses vibrating tensioned strings as sensing elements. The string is continuously excited electromagnetically, and a small number of pickups (contact microphones) observe spectral changes induced by contact. From short-duration audio signals, our system estimates contact location and normal force, and detects slip. To guide design and interpret the sensing mechanism, we derive a physics-based string-vibration simulator that predicts how contact position and force shift vibration modes. Experiments demonstrate millimeter-scale localization, reliable force estimation, and real-time slip detection. Our contributions are: (i) a lightweight, scalable string-based tactile sensing hardware concept for instrumenting extended robot surfaces; (ii) a physics-grounded simulation and analysis tool for contact-induced spectral shifts; and (iii) a real-time inference pipeline that maps vibration measurements to contact state.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的Walk-Along with Robots (WawR)方法为研究公共空间中的自主机器人提供了新的视角和方法，能够更好地洞察这些机器人在动态环境中的行为。

Abstract: As the presence of autonomous robots in public spaces increases-whether navigating campus walkways or neighborhood sidewalks-understanding how to carefully study these robots becomes critical. While HRI research has conducted field studies in public spaces, these are often limited to controlled experiments with prototype robots or structured observational methods, such as the Wizard of Oz technique. However, the autonomous mobile robots we encounter today, particularly delivery robots, operate beyond the control of researchers, navigating dynamic routes and unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, a more deliberate approach is required. Drawing inspiration from public realm ethnography in urban studies, geography, and sociology, this paper proposes the Walk-Along with Robots (WawR) methodology. We outline the key features of this method, the steps we applied in our study, the unique insights it offers, and the ways it can be evaluated. We hope this paper stimulates further discussion on research methodologies for studying autonomous robots in public spaces.

Conclusion: SimToolReal在工具操控上实现了显著的性能提升，并在多任务与对象实例中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The ability to manipulate tools significantly expands the set of tasks a robot can perform. Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.

Abstract: The Boreas Road Trip (Boreas-RT) dataset extends the multi-season Boreas dataset to new and diverse locations that pose challenges for modern autonomous driving algorithms. Boreas-RT comprises 60 sequences collected over 9 real-world routes, totalling 643 km of driving. Each route is traversed multiple times, enabling evaluation in identical environments under varying traffic and, in some cases, weather conditions. The data collection platform includes a 5MP FLIR Blackfly S camera, a 360 degree Navtech RAS6 Doppler-enabled spinning radar, a 128-channel 360 degree Velodyne Alpha Prime lidar, an Aeva Aeries II FMCW Doppler-enabled lidar, a Silicon Sensing DMU41 inertial measurement unit, and a Dynapar wheel encoder. Centimetre-level ground truth is provided via post-processed Applanix POS LV GNSS-INS data. The dataset includes precise extrinsic and intrinsic calibrations, a publicly available development kit, and a live leaderboard for odometry and metric localization. Benchmark results show that many state-of-the-art odometry and localization algorithms overfit to simple driving environments and degrade significantly on the more challenging Boreas-RT routes. Boreas-RT provides a unified dataset for evaluating multi-modal algorithms across diverse road conditions.

Abstract: Task planning for robotic manipulation with large language models (LLMs) is an emerging area. Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.

Abstract: Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks efficiently is a central challenge in robot learning from demonstration. Unlike recent endeavors that focus on directly learning the task in the action domain, we focus on inferring what the robot should achieve in the task, rather than how to do so. To this end, we represent evolving scene states using a series of graphical object relationships. We propose a demonstration segmentation and pooling approach that extracts a series of manipulation graphs and estimates distributions over object states across task phases. In contrast to prior graph-based methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows, our approach captures complete object interactions spanning from the onset of control to the end of the manipulation. To improve robustness when learning from multiple demonstrations, we additionally perform object matching using pre-trained visual features. In extensive experiments, we evaluate our method's demonstration segmentation accuracy and the utility of learning from multiple demonstrations for finding a desired minimal task model. Finally, we deploy the fitted models both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that the resulting task representations support reliable execution across environments.

Motivation: 当前的3D重建方法在生成物体的视觉和几何网格方面表现优异，但其对下游任务（如机器人操控性能）的影响却未得到充分评估。

Method: 通过生成抓取方案并在真实模型上执行，分析各种重建3D网格对抓取的影响，评估姿态误差、抓取的鲁棒性及几何不准确性。

Result: 重建伪影显著减少了抓取姿态候选数量，但在准确估计姿态的情况下，对抓取性能的影响微乎其微。同时，抓取成功与姿态误差之间的关系主要受空间误差的主导，即使是简单的平移误差也能提供对对称物体抓取姿态成功的洞察。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解感知系统与机器人物体操控之间的关系提供了新的视角。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction serves as the foundational layer for numerous robotic perception tasks, including 6D object pose estimation and grasp pose generation. Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots.

Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects. This work presents CFM as a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies, offering a scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems.

Abstract: Hybrid rigid-soft robots combine the precision of rigid manipulators with the compliance and adaptability of soft arms, offering a promising approach for versatile grasping in unstructured environments. However, coordinating hybrid robots remains challenging, due to difficulties in modeling, perception, and cross-domain kinematics. In this work, we present a novel augmented reality (AR)-based physical human-robot interaction framework that enables direct teleoperation of a hybrid rigid-soft robot for simple reaching and grasping tasks. Using an AR headset, users can interact with a simulated model of the robotic system integrated into a general-purpose physics engine, which is superimposed on the real system, allowing simulated execution prior to real-world deployment. To ensure consistent behavior between the virtual and physical robots, we introduce a real-to-simulation parameter identification pipeline that leverages the inherent geometric properties of the soft robot, enabling accurate modeling of its static and dynamic behavior as well as the control system's response.

Conclusion: 该框架将航空学中的逆仿真与机器人中的几何建模连接起来，为轨迹设计和可行性检查提供了严谨的基础。

Abstract: We present a robotics-oriented, coordinate-free formulation of inverse flight dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft on SO(3). Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant. The framework bridges inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous building block for trajectory design and feasibility checks.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for aerial manipulation of an extensible cable that combines a high-fidelity model based on partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reduced-order representation suitable for real-time control. The PDEs are discretised using a finite-difference method, and proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract a reduced-order model (ROM) that retains the dominant deformation modes while significantly reducing computational complexity. Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the framework enables real-time, dynamics-aware control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying suspended flexible cables.

Abstract: Operating in previously visited environments is becoming increasingly crucial for autonomous systems, with direct applications in autonomous driving, surveying, and warehouse or household robotics. This repeated exposure to observing the same areas poses significant challenges for mapping and localization -- key components for enabling any higher-level task. In this work, we propose a novel multi-session framework that builds on map-based localization, in contrast to the common practice of greedily running full SLAM sessions and trying to find correspondences between the resulting maps. Our approach incorporates a topology-informed, uncertainty-aware decision-making mechanism that analyzes the pose-graph structure to detect low-connectivity regions, selectively triggering mapping and loop closing modules. The resulting map and pose-graph are seamlessly integrated into the existing model, reducing accumulated error and enhancing global consistency. We validate our method on overlapping sequences from datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world mine-like environment.

Abstract: Enabling VLA models to predict environmental dynamics, known as world modeling, has been recognized as essential for improving robotic reasoning and generalization. However, current approaches face two main issues: 1. The training objective forces models to over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, which constrains semantic learning and generalization 2. Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models. By significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data, FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies. Experiments on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and shows strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios.

Motivation: 由于当前腿部机器人在没有摄像头或LiDAR的情况下进行可靠的里程计非常具有挑战性，因此需要一种新的方法来解决IMU漂移和关节速度传感器噪声的问题。

Method: 提出了一种纯粹的自有感知状态估计器，仅利用IMU和电机测量来联合估计机器人身体姿态和速度。

Result: 在四个四足平台上进行评估，具体误差分别为：Astrall robot A的水平回路误差为0.1638m，垂直回路误差为0.219m；轮-legged机器人B的水平和垂直回路误差分别为0.2264m和0.199m；机器人C的水平回路误差为7.68m，垂直回路误差为0.540m；Unitree Go2 EDU的水平回路误差为2.2138m，垂直回路误差低于0.1m。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合利用IMU和电机数据来有效减少长时间漂移，提高了腿部机器人的里程计精度。

Abstract: Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a $\sim$200\,m horizontal loop and a $\sim$15\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\,m and 0.219\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\,m and 0.199\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a $\sim$700\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\,m error and a $\sim$20\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\,m error. Unitree Go2 EDU closes a $\sim$120\,m horizontal loop with 2.2138\,m error and a $\sim$8\,m vertical loop with less than 0.1\,m vertical error. github.com/ShineMinxing/Ros2Go2Estimator.git

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整控制参数直观地塑造机器人行为，并在所有测试场景中实现无死锁操作。

Abstract: We present a decentralized, agent agnostic, and safety-aware control framework for human-robot collaboration based on Virtual Model Control (VMC). In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing is enabling soft robots with increasingly complex geometries, creating a demand for sensing solutions that remain compatible with single-material, one-step fabrication. Optical soft sensors are attractive for monolithic printing, but their performance is often degraded by uncontrolled light propagation (ambient coupling, leakage, scattering), while common miti- gation strategies typically require multimaterial interfaces. Here, we present an approach for 3D printed soft optical sensing (SOLen), in which a printed lens is placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. The sensing mechanism relies on deformation-induced lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between the two branches to generate a differential output that encodes both motion direction and amplitude. An acrylate polyurethane resin was modified with lauryl acrylate to improve compliance and optical transmittance, and single-layer optical characterization was used to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance while minimizing DLP layer-related artifacts. The measured refractive index was used in simulations to design a lens profile for a target focal distance, which was then printed with sub-millimeter fidelity. Rotational tests demonstrated reproducible branch-selective signal switching over multiple cycles. These results establish a transferable material-to-optics workflow for soft optical sensors with lens with new functionalities for next-generation soft robots

Abstract: Recent advances in automated vehicles have focused on improving perception performance under adverse weather conditions; however, research on physical hardware solutions remains limited, despite their importance for perception critical applications such as vehicle platooning. Existing approaches, such as hydrophilic or hydrophobic lenses and sprays, provide only partial mitigation, while industrial protection systems imply high cost and they do not enable scalability for automotive deployment.
  To address these limitations, this paper presents a cost-effective hardware solution for rainy conditions, designed to be compatible with multiple cameras simultaneously.
  Beyond its technical contribution, the proposed solution supports sustainability goals in transportation systems. By enabling compatibility with existing camera-based sensing platforms, the system extends the operational reliability of automated vehicles without requiring additional high-cost sensors or hardware replacements. This approach reduces resource consumption, supports modular upgrades, and promotes more cost-efficient deployment of automated vehicle technologies, particularly in challenging weather conditions where system failures would otherwise lead to inefficiencies and increased emissions. The proposed system was able to increase pedestrian detection accuracy of a Deep Learning model from 8.3% to 41.6%.

Abstract: Electro-Ribbon Actuators (ERAs) are lightweight flexural actuators that exhibit ultrahigh displacement and fast movement. However, their embedded sensing relies on capacitive sensors with limited precision, which hinders accurate control. We introduce OS-ERA, an optically sensorized ERA that yields reliable proprioceptive information, and we focus on the design and integration of a sensing solution without affecting actuation. To analyse the complex curvature of an ERA in motion, we design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors. A classifier is trained to map the sensing signals in order to distinguish eight bending states. We validate our model on six held-out trials and compare it against signals' trajectories learned from training runs. Across all tests, the sensing output signals follow the training manifold, and the predicted sequence mirrors real performance and confirms repeatability. Despite deliberate train-test mismatches in actuation speed, the signal trajectories preserve their shape, and classification remains consistently accurate, demonstrating practical voltage- and speed-invariance. As a result, OS-ERA classifies bending states with high fidelity; it is fast and repeatable, solving a longstanding bottleneck of the ERA, enabling steps toward closed-loop control.

Abstract: Lower limb amputation affects millions worldwide, leading to impaired mobility, reduced walking speed, and limited participation in daily and social activities. Powered prosthetic knees can partially restore mobility by actively assisting knee joint torque, improving gait symmetry, sit-to-stand transitions, and walking speed. However, added mass from powered components may diminish these benefits, negatively affecting gait mechanics and increasing metabolic cost. Consequently, optimizing mass distribution, rather than simply minimizing total mass, may provide a more effective and practical solution. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement for a powered prosthetic knee in a small cohort. Compared to below-knee placement, the above-knee configuration demonstrated improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed effects on gait symmetry. Kinematic measures indicated similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Additional testing on ramps and stairs confirmed the robustness of the control strategy across multiple locomotion tasks. These preliminary findings suggest that above-knee placement is functionally feasible and that careful mass distribution can preserve the benefits of powered assistance while mitigating adverse effects of added weight. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and guide design and clinical recommendations.

Conclusion: RA-Nav框架在突发障碍状态转变场景中表现出更高的成功率，并通过真实世界数据的模拟验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing aerial robot navigation systems typically plan paths around static and dynamic obstacles, but fail to adapt when a static obstacle suddenly moves. Integrating environmental semantic awareness enables estimation of potential risks posed by suddenly moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data.

To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.

Abstract: The control of high-dimensional systems, such as soft robots, requires models that faithfully capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance.
