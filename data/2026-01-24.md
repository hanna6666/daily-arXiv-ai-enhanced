Abstract: Testing conversational AI systems at scale across diverse domains necessitates realistic and diverse user interactions capturing a wide array of behavioral patterns. We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains.

### [2] [Public transport challenges and technology-assisted accessibility for visually impaired elderly residents in urban environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15291)
*Jason Pan,Ben Moews*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了如何利用实时数据和人工智能改进对脆弱人群的导航辅助，强调了动态工具在独立出行中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对脆弱群体在独立导航和社会参与方面的需求，尤其是具有多重脆弱性的盲老年人，研究如何借助实时数据和人工智能提升导航辅助工具。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合统计和机器学习技术，重点进行空间分析，分析实时爱丁堡公共交通数据和目标群体的半结构访谈的定性主题分析。

Result: 研究结果显示，爱丁堡交通系统具有高度集中性，记忆驱动的导航具有重要性，且缺乏可用格式的旅行信息。参与者对导航技术的使用情况各异，并愿意采用人工智能。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了动态工具在满足感官和认知需求方面的重要性，以有意义地改善独立出行。

Abstract: Independent navigation is a core aspect of maintaining social participation and individual health for vulnerable populations. While historic cities such as Edinburgh, as the capital of Scotland, often feature well-established public transport systems, urban accessibility challenges remain and are exacerbated by a complex landscape, especially for groups with multiple vulnerabilities such as the blind elderly. With limited research examining how real-time data feeds and developments in artificial intelligence can enhance navigation aids, we address this gap through a mixed-methods approach. Our work combines statistical and machine learning techniques, with a focus on spatial analysis to investigate network coverage, service patterns, and density through live Transport for Edinburgh data, with a qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the mentioned target group. The results demonstrate the highly centralised nature of the city's transport system, the significance of memory-based navigation, and the lack of travel information in usable formats. We also find that participants already use navigation technology to varying degrees and express a willingness to adopt artificial intelligence. Our analysis highlights the importance of dynamic tools in terms of sensory and cognitive needs to meaningfully improve independent travel.

Conclusion: 结合可视化和文本叙述的方法有效提高了用户理解，促进了预防性行动，且技术测试成功率达100%。

Abstract: Diabetes is a significant and continuously rising health challenge in Indonesia. Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as "black boxes," lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索残疾学生在高等教育中面临的支持障碍，寻找机器人支持的潜力。

Method: 通过实证研究比较两种机器人支持的互动角色和表现形式，参与者评估了各系统在多个维度上的表现。

Result: 物理机器人被认为比语音代理更具理解能力，体现形式显著影响社交性、生命力和隐私感知。

Conclusion: 社会机器人能够减轻高等教育中的无障碍障碍，但也存在伦理、社会和技术挑战。

Abstract: Institutional and social barriers in higher education often prevent students with disabilities from effectively accessing support, including lengthy procedures, insufficient information, and high social-emotional demands. This study empirically explores how disabled students perceive robot-based support, comparing two interaction roles, one information based (signposting) and one disclosure based (sounding board), and two embodiment types (physical robot/disembodied voice agent). Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy. We also analyse differences between disability types. These results provide critical insights into the potential of social robots to mitigate accessibility barriers in higher education, while highlighting ethical, social and technical challenges.

### [5] [KnowTeX: Visualizing Mathematical Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15294)
*Elif Uskuplu,Lawrence S. Moss,Valeria de Paiva*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: KnowTeX是一个用户友好的工具，能从LaTeX文档中可视化数学概念的依赖关系，促进数学写作标准化，支持教育和形式化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学知识存在多种形式，转变这些表示形式充满挑战，因此我们提出了一种可视化概念依赖关系的方法。

Method: 展示了一个独立、用户友好的工具KnowTeX，通过简单的"uses"命令，从LaTeX源文档中提取声明之间的关系，生成可预览的图形。

Result: KnowTeX能够生成以DOT和TikZ格式的图形，从而澄清数学文本中的核心结果，支持教育和形式化，并为非正式和正式的数学表示提供资源。

Conclusion: 我们认为依赖图应该成为数学写作的标准特征，既有利于人类读者，也有利于自动化系统。

Abstract: Mathematical knowledge exists in many forms, ranging from informal textbooks and lecture notes to large formal proof libraries, yet moving between these representations remains difficult. Informal texts hide dependencies, while formal systems expose every detail in ways that are not always human-readable. Dependency graphs offer a middle ground by making visible the structure of results, definitions, and proofs. We present KnowTeX, a standalone, user-friendly tool that extends the ideas of Lean's Blueprints, enabling the visualization of conceptual dependencies directly from LaTeX sources. Using a simple "uses" command, KnowTeX extracts relationships among statements and generates previewable graphs in DOT and TikZ formats. Applied to mathematical texts, such graphs clarify core results, support education and formalization, and provide a resource for aligning informal and formal mathematical representations. We argue that dependency graphs should become a standard feature of mathematical writing, benefiting both human readers and automated systems.

### [6] [Elsewise: Authoring AI-Based Interactive Narrative with Possibility Space Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15295)
*Yi Wang,John Joon Young Chung,Melissa Roemmele,Yuqian Sun,Tiffany Wang,Shm Garanganao Almeda,Brett A. Halperin,Yuwen Lu,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本论文提出Elsewise工具，旨在通过绑定故事线概念缩小作者与玩家之间的叙事差距，提高作者的叙事控制力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成性AI的发展，互动叙事的创作面临着作者设想与玩家体验之间的差距，因此需要一种新工具来帮助作者更好地理解和控制叙事空间。

Method: 通过引入名为Elsewise的创作工具，该工具实现了一种新颖的绑定故事线概念，通过用户研究验证其效果。

Result: 用户研究表明，该方法提高了作者对玩家叙事体验的预期，改善了叙事进程的控制与探索。

Conclusion: 引入的Elsewise工具通过绑定故事线的理念，改善了作者对玩家体验叙事的预期，从而使作者能够更有效地控制和探索叙事可能性空间。

Abstract: Interactive narrative (IN) authors craft spaces of divergent narrative possibilities for players to explore, with the player's input determining which narrative possibilities they actually experience. Generative AI can enable new forms of IN by improvisationally expanding on pre-authored content in response to open-ended player input. However, this extrapolation risks widening the gap between author-envisioned and player-experienced stories, potentially limiting the strength of plot progression and the communication of the author's narrative intent. To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces.

### [7] [When Generative AI Meets Extended Reality: Enabling Scalable and Natural Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15308)
*Mingyu Zhu,Jiangong Chen,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了XR与生成式AI的集成，提出生成式AI可以解决XR面临的内容创作及交互难题，促进其更广泛的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管XR的潜力巨大，但由于高成本和复杂的内容创作以及不直观的交互方式，使得其广泛应用受到限制。

Method: 通过具体的三种使用案例来探索XR与生成式AI的集成。

Result: 生成式AI通过启用语言驱动的交互和自动化内容生成，显著降低XR采用的障碍。

Conclusion: XR与生成式人工智能的结合可以克服3D内容创作中的挑战，从而推动更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, provides immersive and interactive experiences across diverse applications, from VR-based education to AR-based assistance and MR-based training. However, widespread XR adoption remains limited due to two key challenges: 1) the high cost and complexity of authoring 3D content, especially for large-scale environments or complex interactions; and 2) the steep learning curve associated with non-intuitive interaction methods like handheld controllers or scripted gestures. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a promising solution by enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction and automating content generation. Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion-based generation, GenAI can interpret ambiguous instructions, understand physical scenes, and generate or manipulate 3D content, significantly lowering barriers to XR adoption. This paper explores the integration of XR and GenAI through three concrete use cases, showing how they address key obstacles in scalability and natural interaction, and identifying technical challenges that must be resolved to enable broader adoption.

### [8] [VegaChat: A Robust Framework for LLM-Based Chart Generation and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15385)
*Marko Hostnik,Rauf Kurbanov,Yaroslav Sokolov,Artem Trofimov*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VegaChat是一个用于生成和评估自然语言可视化的框架，提出了新指标以提高跨库比较的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前NL2VIS系统缺乏标准评估指标和自然语言描述不完全的问题。

Method: 引入Spec Score和Vision Score两个互补的指标，对NL2VIS系统的可视化结果进行生成、验证和评估。

Result: VegaChat在NLV Corpus和ChartLLM的数据集上测试，显示出低无效或空可视化率，并且新指标与人类评价高度相关。

Conclusion: VegaChat有效解决了自然语言到可视化的评估问题，并与人类判断高度一致，提供了可用于跨库比较的度量标准。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-visualization (NL2VIS) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved the accessibility of data visualization. However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.
  We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.
  We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.
  The code and evaluation artifacts are available at https://zenodo.org/records/17062309.

In this paper, we dive into the literature to identify critical gaps in the design and implementation of mental health chatbots. We contribute an operational checklist to help guide the development and design of more trustworthy, safe, and user-friendly chatbots. The checklist serves as both a developmental framework and an auditing tool to ensure ethical and effective chatbot design. We discuss how this checklist is a step towards supporting more responsible design practices and supporting new standards for sociotechnically sound digital mental health tools.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLMs的偏见，发现其假设自闭症人士社交依赖，提出双重同理心问题来改善未来与自闭症人士的互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs（如ChatGPT）可能存在的偏见和对自闭症的假设，以支持自闭症人士。

Method: 使用基于LLM的多智能体系统研究涉及自闭症和非自闭症代理的复杂社会场景。

Result: 研究发现ChatGPT认为自闭症人士在社交上依赖，这可能影响其与自闭症用户的互动以及关于自闭症的信息传达。

Conclusion: 未来的LLMs可以通过纳入双重同理心问题的设计来改善与自闭症人士的互动。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer potential support for autistic people, but this potential requires understanding the implicit perspectives these models might carry, including their biases and assumptions about autism. Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.

### [11] [Reflexis: Supporting Reflexivity and Rigor in Collaborative Qualitative Analysis through Design for Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15445)
*Runlong Ye,Oliver Huang,Patrick Yung Kang Lee,Michael Liut,Carolina Nobre,Ha-Kyung Kong*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Reflexis是一个支持反思性主题分析的协作工具，它通过促进反思和有效对话来增加分析深度，同时还揭示了设计过程中的一些重要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件工具往往优先考虑速度和共识，而忽视了深层解释的重要性，因此需要开发能够支持更深层次分析的方法和工具。

Method: 介绍了一种名为Reflexis的协作工作区，以促进研究者的反思、代码演变的透明性以及协作解释的生产性对话。

Result: 参与者通过使用Reflexis进行了更细致的反思，并将分歧重新框定为富有成效的对话。研究还揭示了设计中的关键张力，包括对更高层次的网络化备忘录的需求和对预警时机的用户控制欲望。

Conclusion: Reflexis提供了一种设计框架，旨在支持深入的协作分析，同时优先考虑严谨性和透明度。

Abstract: Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) is a critical method for generating deep interpretive insights. Yet its core tenets, including researcher reflexivity, tangible analytical evolution, and productive disagreement, are often poorly supported by software tools that prioritize speed and consensus over interpretive depth. To address this gap, we introduce Reflexis, a collaborative workspace that centers these practices. It supports reflexivity by integrating in-situ reflection prompts, makes code evolution transparent and tangible, and scaffolds collaborative interpretation by turning differences into productive, positionality-aware dialogue. Results from our paired-analyst study (N=12) indicate that Reflexis encouraged participants toward more granular reflection and reframed disagreements as productive conversations. The evaluation also surfaced key design tensions, including a desire for higher-level, networked memos and more user control over the timing of proactive alerts. Reflexis contributes a design framework for tools that prioritize rigor and transparency to support deep, collaborative interpretation in an age of automation.

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一个跨学科的设计框架，用于设计情感和伦理适应的自我克隆聊天机器人，以帮助心理健康领域的自我互动。

Abstract: As digital tools increasingly mediate mental health care, self-clone chatbots can offer a uniquely novel approach to intra-personal exploration and self-derived support. Trained to replicate users' conversational patterns, self-clones allow users to talk to themselves through their digital replicas. Despite the promises, these systems may carry risks around identity confusion, negative reinforcement, and blurred user agency. Through interviews with 16 mental health professionals and 6 general users, we aim to uncover tensions and design opportunities in this emerging space to guide responsible self-clone design. Our analysis produces a design framework organized around three priorities: (1) defining goals and grounding the approach in existing therapeutic models, (2) design dimensions including the self-clone persona and user-clone relationship dynamics, and (3) considerations for minimizing potential emotional and ethical harms. This framework contributes an interdisciplinary foundation for designing self-clone chatbots as AI-mediated self-interaction tools that are emotionally and ethically attuned in mental health contexts.

Motivation: 探讨情感与动机之间的关系，以强调情感在激励过程中的作用，帮助理解如何更好地调动个体和群体的积极性。

Method: 通过总结理论和定义，以及探讨情感与动机之间的相互作用，从认知、情感和意志三个维度分析动机。

Conclusion: 情感在激励中的重要性不容忽视，管理者和员工应共同努力，营造良好的情感氛围，以提高工作场所的动机水平。

Abstract: It is obvious that emotions are causal variables of motivation, as they elicit states, forces and energies that trigger and guide labor behavior. Thus, a motivational tension that is not informed by needs alone, but also by emotions, intention, goals and means to achieve them is therefore generated within the mental, emotional and physical plane. Based on Montserrat's opinion (2004: 131), that "to motivate means, above all, to move and to transmit an emotion", we will undertake to identify the mutual influences between emotions and motivation. The main objectives of this article are to display a summary of the theories and definitions about emotions and to explore the links between emotions and motivation. Although interconnected, emotions and motivation can be contemplated from a double perspective: (1) emotions influence motivation and (2) motivation influences emotions. Moreover, we will consider motivation from three dimensions: (1) cognitive, (2) affective and (3) volitional. The ultimate purpose of this article is to issue a warning as to the importance of the emotional side of motivation. An important part in implementing such insight is to be played by managers (and by employees, also), who should develop the skills and know-how needed to keep a well-balanced emotional climate that effectively favors the maximization of individual and group motivation at the workplace.

Conclusion: XEM²系统能够可靠地测量和可视化各个肌肉群的运动负荷，有助于提升运动监测的效果，避免不均衡的锻炼。

Abstract: We present a novel system for camera-based measurement and visualization of muscle work based on the Hill-Type-Muscle-Model: the exercise exertion muscle-work monitor (\textit{XEM}$^{2}$). Our aim is to complement and, thus, address issues of established measurement techniques that offer imprecise data for non-uniform movements (burned calories) or provide limited information on strain across different body parts (self-perception scales). We validate the reliability of XEM's measurements through a technical evaluation of ten participants and five exercises. Further, we assess the acceptance, usefulness, benefits, and opportunities of \textit{XEM}$^{2}$ in an empirical user study. Our results show that \textit{XEM}$^{2}$ provides reliable values of muscle work and supports participants in understanding their workout while also providing reliable information about perceived exertion per muscle group. With this paper, we introduce a novel system capable of measuring and visualizing exertion for single muscle groups, which has the potential to improve exercise monitoring to prevent unbalanced workouts.

Conclusion: PromptHelper能够显著提高用户的探索感和表达能力，同时不会增加认知负担，并能帮助用户在写作中更好地表达意图。

Abstract: Prompting is central to interaction with AI systems, yet many users struggle to explore alternative directions, articulate creative intent, or understand how variations in prompts shape model outputs. We introduce prompt recommender systems (PRS) as an interaction approach that supports exploration, suggesting contextually relevant follow-up prompts. We present PromptHelper, a PRS prototype integrated into an AI chatbot that surfaces semantically diverse prompt suggestions while users work on real writing tasks. We evaluate PromptHelper in a 2x2 fully within-subjects study (N=32) across creative and academic writing tasks. Results show that PromptHelper significantly increases users' perceived exploration and expressiveness without increasing cognitive workload. Qualitative findings illustrate how prompt recommendations help users branch into new directions, overcome uncertainty about what to ask next, and better articulate their intent. We discuss implications for designing AI interfaces that scaffold exploratory interaction while preserving user agency, and release open-source resources to support research on prompt recommendation.

Abstract: Job interview anxiety is a prevalent challenge among university students and can undermine both performance and confidence in high-stakes evaluative situations. Social robots have shown promise in reducing anxiety through emotional support, yet how such systems should balance psychological safety with effective instructional guidance remains an open question. In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative. Quantitative measures further showed significant reductions in interview-related social and communication anxiety, while maintaining high perceived warmth and therapeutic alliance. We synthesize these findings into an Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem framework, highlighting user agency as a key mechanism for balancing emotional support and instructional guidance in social robot coaching systems.

TL;DR: 我们提出一种以身体为媒介的体现式日记，与传统书写日记相比，参与者在缺乏书写规范时倾向于进行更自由的情感表达，促进了对隐藏感受的反思。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的日记实践中，作者通过书写表达和处理他们的思想。我们提出了一种以身体为媒介的替代方案，称为体现式日记。

Method: 在虚拟现实中实施体现式日记，并进行了一项被试内用户研究（n=20），探索该过程中的新出现行为，并将其表现和反思特性与书写日记进行比较。

Result: 当缺少基于书写的规范和条件时，参与者默认倾向于不加过滤的情感表达，常常完全放弃语言。相反，潜意识的身体动作和声学特征揭示了更深层次、有时被隐藏的感受，促使在情感表达之后进行反思。

Conclusion: 我们讨论了体现式日记的能力和缺陷，最终质疑了反思是否以语言推理为最终结果的观点。

Abstract: In traditional journaling practices, authors express and process their thoughts by writing them down. We propose a somaesthetic-inspired alternative that uses the human body, rather than written words, as the medium of expression. We coin this embodied journaling, as people's isolated body movements and spoken words become the canvas of reflection. We implemented embodied journaling in virtual reality and conducted a within-subject user study (n=20) to explore the emergent behaviours from the process and to compare its expressive and reflective qualities to those of written journaling. When writing-based norms and affordances were absent, we found that participants defaulted towards unfiltered emotional expression, often forgoing words altogether. Rather, subconscious body motion and paralinguistic acoustic qualities unveiled deeper, sometimes hidden feelings, prompting reflection that happens after emotional expression rather than during it. We discuss both the capabilities and pitfalls of embodied journaling, ultimately challenging the idea that reflection culminates in linguistic reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究提出StreetDesignAI，一个支持自行车基础设施包容性设计的系统，通过多视角反馈提升设计师的用户理解与设计能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计包容性自行车基础设施时，理解不同用户群体的需求至关重要，但设计师常常难以预见不同骑行者的体验差异。

Method: 开发并测试一个名为StreetDesignAI的交互系统，支持设计师在街道背景下进行多视角反馈评估。

Result: 通过一项包含26名交通专业人士的研究，发现结构化的跨视角反馈显著提高了设计师对不同用户视角的理解和对设计决策的自信，同时提高了工作满意度和专业采纳意图。

Conclusion: 引入基于角色的多代理评估可以促进更具包容性的设计，并通过明确的冲突促进设计探索的深度与广度。

Abstract: Designing inclusive cycling infrastructure requires balancing competing needs of diverse user groups, yet designers often struggle to anticipate how different cyclists experience the same street. We investigate how persona-based multi-agent evaluation can support inclusive design by making experiential conflicts explicit. We present StreetDesignAI, an interactive system that enables designers to (1) ground evaluation in street context through imagery and map data, (2) receive parallel feedback from cyclist personas spanning confident to cautious users, and (3) iteratively modify designs while surfacing conflicts across perspectives. A within-subjects study with 26 transportation professionals demonstrates that structured multi-perspective feedback significantly improves designers' understanding of diverse user perspectives, ability to identify persona needs, and confidence in translating them into design decisions, with higher satisfaction and stronger intention for professional adoption. Qualitative findings reveal how conflict surfacing transforms design exploration from single-perspective optimization toward deliberate trade-off reasoning. We discuss implications for AI tools that scaffold inclusive design through disagreement as an interaction primitive.

TL;DR: UXCascade是一个交互式工具，通过多层次分析工作流程来优化模拟用户代理生成的可用性反馈，使UX设计更具针对性和可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模拟用户代理在可用性测试中生成的数据冗长无序，难以提炼出可操作见解的问题。

Method: 通过多层次分析工作流程，提取、汇总并展示模拟用户代理生成的可用性反馈。

Result: UXCascade展示了多层次分析的有效性，允许UX专业人员从模式到具体的UX干预进行探索性分析。

Conclusion: UXCascade工具能够有效整合到现有工作流程中，支持早期界面开发中的快速反馈循环。

Abstract: Simulated user agents are increasingly used in usability testing to support fast, iterative UX workflows, as they generate rich data such as action logs and think-aloud reasoning, but the unstructured nature of this output often obscures actionable insights. We present UXCascade, an interactive tool for extracting, aggregating, and presenting agent-generated usability feedback at scale. Our core contribution is a multi-level analysis workflow that (1) highlights patterns across persona traits, goals, and outcomes, (2) links agent reasoning to specific issues, and (3) supports actionable design improvements. UXCascade operationalizes this approach by listing agent goals, traits, and issues in a structured overview. Practitioners can explore detailed reasoning traces and annotated views, propose interface edits, and assess their impact across personas. This enables a top-down, exploration-driven analysis from patterns to concrete UX interventions. A user study with eight UX professionals demonstrates that UXCascade integrates into existing workflows, enabling iterative feedback during early-stage interface development.

Conclusion: 生物-数字系统的分类与路径能够促进生物与数字主体的协同计算，支持可再生生态系统，并激发在人机交互中的计算新范式。

Abstract: Bio-digital systems that merge microbial life with technology promise new modes of computation, combining biological adaptability with digital precision. Yet realizing this potential symbiotically -- where biological and digital agents co-adapt and co-process -- remains elusive, largely due to the absence of a shared vocabulary bridging biology and computing. Consequently, microbes are often constrained to uni-directional roles, functioning as sensors or actuators rather than as active, computational partners in bio-digital systems. In response, we propose a taxonomy and pathways that articulate and expand the roles of biological and digital entities for synergetic bio-digital computation. Using this taxonomy, we analysed 70 systems across HCI, design, and engineering, identifying how biological mechanisms can be mapped onto computational abstractions. We argue that such mappings enable computationally actionable directions that foster richer and reciprocal relationships in bio-digital systems, supporting regenerative ecologies across time and scale while inspiring new paradigms for computation in HCI.

TL;DR: 随着AI系统的普及，不对齐问题日益突出，传统方法忽视用户的积极参与。研究通过研讨会探索用户如何理解和响应不对齐，发现用户体验的不对齐多为意外反应与社交崩溃，而建议设计支持持续的对齐实践。


<details>

Motivation: 为了寻求更好地理解在AI与用户交互过程中不对齐的问题，以及如何将用户作为积极参与者看待，而不是被动接收者。

Method: 通过参与式研讨会结合不对齐日记和生成设计活动，研究用户对不对齐的理解与贡献意愿。

Result: 用户体验到的不对齐更多的是意外反应和任务或社交的崩溃，而非抽象的伦理违规。参与者提到了多种角色，包括调整和解释模型行为，以及故意不参与作为一种对齐策略。

Conclusion: 我们建议在设计系统时，支持将对齐视为一个持续的、情境化的和共享的实践。

Abstract: As AI systems become embedded in everyday practice, value misalignment has emerged as a pressing concern. Yet, dominant alignment approaches remain model centric, treating users as passive recipients of prespecified values rather than as epistemic agents who encounter and respond to misalignment during interactions. Drawing on situated perspectives, we frame alignment as an interactional practice co-constructed during human AI interaction. We investigate how users understand and wish to contribute to this process through a participatory workshop that combines misalignment diaries with generative design activities. We surface how misalignments materialise in practice and how users envision acting on them, grounded in the context of researchers using Large Language Models as research assistants. Our findings show that misalignments are experienced less as abstract ethical violations than as unexpected responses, and task or social breakdowns. Participants articulated roles ranging from adjusting and interpreting model behaviour to deliberate non-engagement as an alignment strategy. We conclude with implications for designing systems that support alignment as an ongoing, situated, and shared practice.

Conclusion: 推荐在网络犯罪受害者中提供以创伤为基础的支持，并提出协作和情境敏感的策略来应对网络犯罪的有害影响。

Abstract: How do individuals recover from cybercrimes? Victims experience various types of harm after cybercrimes, including monetary loss, data breaches, negative emotions, and even psychological trauma. The aspects that support their recovery process and contribute to individual cyber resilience remain underinvestigated. To address this gap, we interviewed 18 cybercrime victims from Western Europe using a trauma-informed approach. We identified four common stages following victimization: recognition, coping, processing, and recovery. Participants adopted various strategies to mitigate the impact of cybercrime and used different indicators to describe recovery. While they mostly relied on social support and self-regulation for emotional coping, service providers largely determined whether victims were able to recover their money. Internal factors, external support, and context sensitivity collectively contribute to individuals' cyber resilience. We recommend trauma-informed support for cybercrime victims. Extending our conceptualization of individual cyber resilience, we propose collaborative and context-sensitive strategies to address the harmful impacts of cybercrime.

Abstract: Motivated reasoning -- the idea that individuals processing information may be motivated to reach a certain conclusion, whether it be accurate or predetermined -- has been well-explored as a human phenomenon. However, it is unclear whether base LLMs mimic these motivational changes. Replicating 4 prior political motivated reasoning studies, we find that base LLM behavior does not align with expected human behavior. Furthermore, base LLM behavior across models shares some similarities, such as smaller standard deviations and inaccurate argument strength assessments. We emphasize the importance of these findings for researchers using LLMs to automate tasks such as survey data collection and argument assessment.

Result: 分析发现四种主要的行为改变策略，并识别了当前评估实践的关键特征。

Conclusion: 本系统评价总结了社交机器人在促进行为改变中的四种策略和当前评估实践的关键特征，并就未来研究方向提出建议。

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly applied as health behavior change interventions, yet actionable knowledge to guide their design and evaluation remains limited. This systematic review synthesizes (1) the behavior change strategies used in existing HRI studies employing social robots to promote health behavior change, and (2) the evaluation methods applied to assess behavior change outcomes. Relevant literature was identified through systematic database searches and hand searches. Analysis of 39 studies revealed four overarching categories of behavior change strategies: coaching strategies, counseling strategies, social influence strategies, and persuasion-enhancing strategies. These strategies highlight the unique affordances of social robots as behavior change interventions and offer valuable design heuristics. The review also identified key characteristics of current evaluation practices, including study designs, settings, durations, and outcome measures, on the basis of which we propose several directions for future HRI research.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于电磁驱动的微软体机器人，为其在狭窄水下环境中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In narrow, unstructured underwater environments such as environmental monitoring and minimally invasive medical procedures, micro soft robots exhibit unique advantages due to their flexible movement capabilities and small size. At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces.

Conclusion: 我们的方法支持在多种人形机器人上实现鲁棒、可扩展且与具体形态无关的控制。

Abstract: We present a scalable framework for cross-embodiment humanoid robot control by learning a shared latent representation that unifies motion across humans and diverse humanoid platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and legged humanoid robots. Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated framework for enhancing the safety and operational efficiency of robotic arms in laparoscopic surgery by addressing key challenges in collision detection and minimum distance estimation. By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining analytical precision with machine learning algorithms to enhance the precision and reliability of robotic systems.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通用的无人机控制接口，通过新模型上下文协议（MCP）标准，有效解决了无人机与大型语言模型（LLM）之间的接口问题。

Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) for drone control can have a transformative impact on drone capabilities, especially when real world information can be integrated with drone sensing, command, and control, part of a growing field of physical AI. Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control.

Motivation: 解决现有VLA系统中缺乏力感知适应的问题，以提高接触、合规或不确定性任务中的安全性与成功率。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型(VLM)进行任务上下文解释，并结合变阻抗控制(VIC)，通过实时力/扭矩反馈调节控制参数。

Conclusion: CompliantVLA-adaptor在接触丰富的机器人操作任务中提升了安全性与有效性，展示了明显的成功率提升，并为安全接触操作提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We propose a CompliantVLA-adaptor that augments the state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with vision-language model (VLM)-informed context-aware variable impedance control (VIC) to improve the safety and effectiveness of contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, Pi0, OpenVLA-oft) typically output position, but lack force-aware adaptation, leading to unsafe or failed interactions in physical tasks involving contact, compliance, or uncertainty. In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\% to 17.29\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs. We release our code, prompts, and force-torque-impedance-scenario context datasets at https://sites.google.com/view/compliantvla.

Abstract: Targeted drug delivery in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract using magnetic robots offers a promising alternative to systemic treatments. However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a "model-calibration bottleneck", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace. This work demonstrates a rapidly deployable, model-free control framework capable of precise magnetic manipulation in a large workspace,validated using a 2D GI phantom.

Conclusion: 本研究为未来的无人机平台提供了一种方法基础，以便结合气流传感器与其他传感器，增强气体踪源和气流追踪的数据收集能力。

Abstract: As environmental disasters happen more frequently and severely, seeking the source of pollutants or harmful particulates using plume tracking becomes even more important. Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.

Conclusion: AION在探索、导航效率和安全性等多项评估指标上表现出色，证明了其在视觉基础的空中目标导航中的有效性。

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) requires an agent to autonomously explore an unknown environment and navigate toward target objects specified by a semantic label. While prior work has primarily studied zero-shot ObjectNav under 2D locomotion, extending it to aerial platforms with 3D locomotion capability remains underexplored. Aerial robots offer superior maneuverability and search efficiency, but they also introduce new challenges in spatial perception, dynamic control, and safety assurance. In this paper, we propose AION for vision-based aerial ObjectNav without relying on external localization or global maps. AION is an end-to-end dual-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework that decouples exploration and goal-reaching behaviors into two specialized policies. We evaluate AION on the AI2-THOR benchmark and further assess its real-time performance in IsaacSim using high-fidelity drone models. Experimental results show that AION achieves superior performance across comprehensive evaluation metrics in exploration, navigation efficiency, and safety.

Abstract: Accurate alignment of multi-degree-of-freedom rehabilitation robots is essential for safe and effective patient training. This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.

Result: 在挑战性的无保护掉头场景中，DualShield相比不同规划范式的领先方法显著提高了安全性和任务效率。

Conclusion: DualShield在不确定和对抗性交互下显著提高了安全性和任务效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for multimodal motion planning in autonomous driving. However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty.

Motivation: 希望通过直观的手势控制和即时反馈提升无人机操作的安全性和可预测性，尤其是在动态飞行环境中。

Method: 采用穿戴式IMU手套接口，结合中值滤波和Madgwick算法进行姿态估计，并实施实时数据传输。

Result: 实验验证了手势命令的快速执行、稳定的手势与无人机运动之间的耦合，以及警报的及时性。

Conclusion: Glove2UAV实现了通过手势控制无人机的创新接口，提供快速、稳定的命令执行及有效的振动警报，增强了飞行安全性。

Abstract: This paper presents Glove2UAV, a wearable IMU-glove interface for intuitive UAV control through hand and finger gestures, augmented with vibrotactile warnings for exceeding predefined speed thresholds. To promote safer and more predictable interaction in dynamic flight, Glove2UAV is designed as a lightweight and easily deployable wearable interface intended for real-time operation. Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights. The results show fast gesture-based command execution, stable coupling between gesture dynamics and platform motion, correct operation of the core command set in our trials, and timely delivery of vibratile warning cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在受限制环境中进行隐秘操作时，需要一种不依赖GNSS的导航解决方案，以确保UUV的隐蔽性和安全性。

Method: 利用无人机或水面无人机部署信标，创建合成地标网络，辅以层次规划器来生成自适应航线。

Result: 建立了一种通过信标网络和层次规划器的导航方案，使UUV能够在复杂环境中有效定位和导航。

Conclusion: 通过部署信标网络，这种方法确保UUV在没有GNSS支持的情况下仍能精确导航，并优化路径，保持隐蔽性。

Abstract: Autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) enable military and civilian covert operations in coastal areas without relying on support vessels or Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore. These beacons either submerged or floating emit acoustic signals for UUV localisation and navigation. A hierarchical planner generates an adaptive route for the drones executing primitive actions while continuously monitoring and replanning as needed to maintain trajectory accuracy.

Conclusion: TeNet框架能够高效地生成紧凑的机器人控制策略，适合资源受限且需要实时控制的任务。

Abstract: Robots that follow natural-language instructions often either plan at a high level using hand-designed interfaces or rely on large end-to-end models that are difficult to deploy for real-time control. We propose TeNet (Text-to-Network), a framework for instantiating compact, task-specific robot policies directly from natural language descriptions. TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control. These results show that text-conditioned hypernetworks offer a practical way to build compact, language-driven controllers for ressource-constrained robot control tasks with real-time requirements.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的方法在不同场景和安装配置下表现出色，能够实现准确的LiDAR转动电机校准和稳健的定位。

Abstract: Accurate calibration and robust localization are fundamental for downstream tasks in spinning actuated LiDAR applications. Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

Conclusion: PUMA展示了在复杂环境中进行灵活跳跃的优越能力与稳定性。

Abstract: Parkour tasks for quadrupeds have emerged as a promising benchmark for agile locomotion. While human athletes can effectively perceive environmental characteristics to select appropriate footholds for obstacle traversal, endowing legged robots with similar perceptual reasoning remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on hierarchical controllers that follow pre-computed footholds, thereby constraining the robot's real-time adaptability and the exploratory potential of reinforcement learning. To overcome these challenges, we present PUMA, an end-to-end learning framework that integrates visual perception and foothold priors into a single-stage training process. This approach leverages terrain features to estimate egocentric polar foothold priors, composed of relative distance and heading, guiding the robot in active posture adaptation for parkour tasks. Extensive experiments conducted in simulation and real-world environments across various discrete complex terrains, demonstrate PUMA's exceptional agility and robustness in challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 在复杂的室内环境中，有效避开障碍物是实现人形机器人平稳移动的重要挑战，但缺乏有效的表示方法使得直接学习人形与障碍物之间的映射变得困难。

Method: 提出了人形潜在场（HumanoidPF），将人形机器人与障碍物之间的关系编码为无碰撞的运动方向，利用强化学习（RL）促进穿越技能学习，同时开发混合场景生成方法以生成多样化的挑战场景。

Result: 通过使用HumanoidPF进行无碰撞运动方向的编码，我们成功提升了人形机器人的穿越技能，并在真实环境中验证了其有效性，且观察到模拟与现实之间几乎没有差距。

Conclusion: 我们的方法有效提升了人形机器人在复杂室内场景中的穿越能力，并成功实现了模拟到现实的转移。

Abstract: We study the problem of collision-free humanoid traversal in cluttered indoor scenes, such as hurdling over objects scattered on the floor, crouching under low-hanging obstacles, or squeezing through narrow passages. To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the effectiveness of our method. Demos and code can be found in our website: https://axian12138.github.io/CAT/.

Conclusion: DextER在DexGYS数据集上表现出色，成功率达到67.14%，超越现有技术，且在意图对齐上有显著提升。

Abstract: Language-driven dexterous grasp generation requires the models to understand task semantics, 3D geometry, and complex hand-object interactions. While vision-language models have been applied to this problem, existing approaches directly map observations to grasp parameters without intermediate reasoning about physical interactions. We present DextER, Dexterous Grasp Generation with Embodied Reasoning, which introduces contact-based embodied reasoning for multi-finger manipulation. Our key insight is that predicting which hand links contact where on the object surface provides an embodiment-aware intermediate representation bridging task semantics with physical constraints. DextER autoregressively generates embodied contact tokens specifying which finger links contact where on the object surface, followed by grasp tokens encoding the hand configuration. On DexGYS, DextER achieves 67.14% success rate, outperforming state-of-the-art by 3.83%p with 96.4% improvement in intention alignment. We also demonstrate steerable generation through partial contact specification, providing fine-grained control over grasp synthesis.

Conclusion: 提出了一种SE2(3)群导航模型构建方法，使得导航模型更接近于完全自主。

Abstract: One of core advantages of the SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy.

Abstract: We propose a control framework that integrates model-based bipedal locomotion with residual reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve robust and adaptive walking in the presence of real-world uncertainties. Our approach leverages a model-based controller, comprising a Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) trajectory planner and a whole-body controller, as a reliable base policy. To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss. This supervision enables the policy to efficiently learn corrective behaviors that compensate for unmodeled effects without extensive reward shaping. Our method demonstrates improved robustness and generalization across a range of randomized conditions, offering a scalable solution for sim-to-real transfer in bipedal locomotion.

Conclusion: IVRA方法在多个VLA架构中表现出色，显著提升了2D和3D操控的成功率，尤其在数据较少的情况下，具有广泛的适应性和应用价值。

Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models flatten image patches into a 1D token sequence, weakening the 2D spatial cues needed for precise manipulation. We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%).

Abstract: Robot foundation models are beginning to deliver on the promise of generalist robotic agents, yet progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale real-world manipulation datasets. Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.
