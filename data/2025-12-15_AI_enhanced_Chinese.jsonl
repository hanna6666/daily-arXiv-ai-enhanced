This is especially true in biological applications, where skill rather than knowledge is often the primary barrier for an untrained person. The challenge is that these studies are difficult to execute well and can take months to plan and run.\n  Here we report the results of a pilot study that attempted to empirically measure the magnitude of \\emph{skills-based uplift} caused by access to an AI reasoning model, compared with a control group that had only internet access. Participants -- drawn from a diverse pool of Los Alamos National Laboratory employees with no prior wet-lab experience -- were asked to transform \\ecoli{} with a provided expression construct, induce expression of a reporter peptide, and have expression confirmed by mass spectrometry.\n  We recorded quantitative outcomes (e.g., successful completion of experimental segments) and qualitative observations about how participants interacted with the AI system, the internet, laboratory equipment, and one another.

While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u65b0\u624b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8eAI\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d1\u5c55\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u52a0\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

First, these systems frequently operate as 'black boxes', leaving their decision-making processes opaque. Second, audit logs often lack reliability, as the entity operating the system may alter them. In this work, we introduce the concept of Immutable Explainability, an architecture designed to address both challenges simultaneously. Our approach combines an interpretable inference engine - implemented through fuzzy logic to produce a transparent trace of each decision - with a cryptographic anchoring mechanism that records this trace on a blockchain, ensuring that it is tamper-evident and independently verifiable. To validate the approach, we implemented a heuristic pipeline integrating lexical and prosodic analysis within an explicit Mamdani-type multimodal fusion engine. Each inference generates an auditable record that is subsequently anchored on a public blockchain (Sepolia Testnet). We evaluated the system using the Spanish MEACorpus 2023, employing both the original corpus transcriptions and those generated by Whisper. The results show that our fuzzy-fusion approach outperforms baseline methods (linear and unimodal fusion).

Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To more precisely execute the desired locomotion commands, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation.

Medicinal chemists must navigate a vast protein space to identify target proteins that meet three criteria: physical and functional interactions, therapeutic impact, and docking potential.

We present HAPPIER, an AI-powered tool that supports hypothesis generation with integrated multi-criteria support for target identification. HAPPIER enables medicinal chemists to 1) efficiently explore and verify proteins in a single integrated graph component showing multi-criteria satisfaction and 2) validate AI suggestions with domain knowledge.

However, while many such manipulators offer versatility in grasp-like interactions, they are not optimized for non-prehensile actions like pressing, rubbing, or scraping -- manipulations needed for many common tasks. To perform such tasks, humans use a range of different body parts or tools with different rigidity, friction, etc., according to the properties most effective for a given task. Here, we discuss a taxonomy for the key properties of a non-actuated end-effector, laying the groundwork for a systematic understanding of the affordances of non-prehensile manipulators. We then present a modular tool system, based on the taxonomy, that can be used by a standard two-fingered gripper to extend its versatility and effectiveness in performing such actions.

The hardware overhead of commonly adopted VR-based mHealth solutions further hinders their widespread clinical application. Therefore, we developed Breast-Rehab, a novel, low-cost mHealth system to provide patients with out-of-hospital upper limb rehabilitation management. Breast-Rehab integrates a bespoke human action recognition algorithm with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. By fusing visual and 3D skeletal data, our model accurately segments exercise videos recorded in uncontrolled home environments, outperforming standard models. These segmented clips, combined with a domain-specific knowledge base, guide a multi-modal large language model to generate clinically relevant assessment reports. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead and mitigates model hallucinations. We implemented the system as a WeChat Mini Program and a nurse-facing dashboard.

The proposed method simultaneously handles multiple position and velocity constraints through an explicit closed-form control law, eliminating the need to solve a Quadratic Program (QP) at every control step and enabling efficient real-time implementation. This letter derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the closed-form expression remains non-singular, thereby ensuring well-posedness of the CBF solution to multi-constraint problem. The controller is validated in both simulation and hardware experiments on a custom-built Stewart platform prototype, demonstrating safetyguaranteed performance that is comparable to the QP-based formulation, while reducing computation time by more than an order of magnitude.

Most of the RGB-based navigation systems only guarantee coarse, meter-level accuracy, making them less suitable for the precise positioning phase of mobile manipulation. This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects. These results show that precise last-meter navigation can be achieved at a category-level without depth, LiDAR, or map priors, enabling a scalable pathway toward unified mobile manipulation.

We term this structural reliance Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI). HISOAI systems represent an ethical failure and an unsustainable economic dependency, where human workers function as hidden operational fallbacks rather than strategic collaborators. To rectify this, we propose the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm. AFHE mandates a technological design where the AI component must achieve a minimum, quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This standard is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient (alpha), a metric that determines the proportion of tasks that the AI successfully processes without mandatory human substitution. We introduce the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that requires the system to meet a specified alpha threshold across both offline and shadow testing. By enforcing this structural separation, the AFHE framework redefines the human's role to focus exclusively on high-value tasks, including ethical oversight, boundary pushing, and strategic model tuning, thereby ensuring true system transparency and operational independence.

While co-training with external reasoning data helps, it requires experienced tuning and data-related overhead. Beyond such external dependencies, we identify an intrinsic cause within VLA datasets: modality imbalance, where language diversity is much lower than visual and action diversity. This imbalance biases the model toward visual shortcuts and language forgetting. To address this, we introduce BayesVLA, a Bayesian factorization that decomposes the policy into a visual-action prior, supporting seeing-to-act, and a language-conditioned likelihood, enabling prompt-to-specify. This inherently preserves generalization and promotes instruction following. We further incorporate pre- and post-contact phases to better leverage pre-trained foundation models.

While intent communication has been widely studied, existing approaches lack the spatial specificity and semantic depth necessary to convey robot touch actions. We present Mirror Skin, a cephalopod-inspired concept that utilizes high-resolution, mirror-like visual feedback on robotic skin. By mapping in-situ visual representations of a human's body parts onto the corresponding robot's touch region, Mirror Skin communicates who shall initiate touch, where it will occur, and when it is imminent. To inform the design of Mirror Skin, we conducted a structured design exploration with experts in virtual reality (VR), iteratively refining six key dimensions. A subsequent controlled user study demonstrated that Mirror Skin significantly enhances accuracy and reduces response times for interpreting touch intent.

The reduced PMP model provides a closed-form optimal control law for the joint accelerations, while the Gradient Descent module determines the corresponding time horizons by minimizing a cost functional built directly from the full Rigid-Body Dynamics. Structural-mechanics reaction analysis is used only to initialize feasible joint velocities-most critically the azimuthal component-ensuring that the optimizer begins in a physically admissible region. The resulting kinematic trajectories and dynamically consistent time horizons are then supplied to the symbolic Euler-Lagrange model to yield closed-form inverse-dynamics inputs.

Although numerous studies have explored how researchers employ these tools for scientific writing, their concrete implementation, limitations, and design challenges within the literature review process remain underexplored.

We identified three recurring gaps: (i) lack of trust in outputs, (ii) persistent verification burden, and (iii) requiring multiple tools. This motivates our proposal of six design goals and a high-level framework that operationalizes them through improved related papers visualization, verification at every step, and human-feedback alignment with generation-guided explanations.

However, it can become tedious to make many updates due to the need to individually select and change numerous items in a graph. Our research investigates natural language input as an alternative method for editing network graphs.

Scenario-based testing is a prominent approach to addressing this challenge, as it involves the systematic simulation of objects and environments. Operational Design Domains (ODDs) are usually described using a taxonomy of qualitative designations for individual objects. However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations. This concept is demonstrated using a one-dimensional, laterally guided manoeuvre involving a shunting locomotive within a constrained ODD. In this example, mODDs are defined and refined into narrow taxonomies that enable test case generation. Obstacles are represented as generic cubes of varying sizes, providing a simplified yet robust means of evaluating perception performance. A series of tests were conducted in a closed-loop, co-simulated virtual environment featuring photorealistic rendering and simulated LiDAR, GNSS and camera sensors. The results demonstrate how edge cases in obstacle detection can be systematically explored and how perception quality can be evaluated based on observed vehicle behaviour, using crash versus safe stop as the outcome metrics. These findings support the development of a standardised framework for safety argumentation and offer a practical step towards the validation and authorisation of automated driving functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u5206\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\uff08ODDs\uff09\u4e3a\u5fae\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\uff08mODDs\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u8f6c\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ODDs\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u90e8\u5206\uff08micro-ODDs\uff09\u5e76\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u793a\u8303\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a2a\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u5728\u969c\u788d\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u5f00\u53d1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6388\u6743\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u97f3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u65ad\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u65ad\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u50f5\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8bed\u97f3AI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u5b64\u7acb\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5411\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7f16\u6392\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002"}}

This field is exploding with new models and datasets, making it both exciting and challenging to keep pace with. This survey offers a clear and structured guide to the VLA landscape. We design it to follow the natural learning path of a researcher: we start with the basic Modules of any VLA model, trace the history through key Milestones, and then dive deep into the core Challenges that define recent research frontier. Our main contribution is a detailed breakdown of the five biggest challenges in: (1) Representation, (2) Execution, (3) Generalization, (4) Safety, and (5) Dataset and Evaluation. This structure mirrors the developmental roadmap of a generalist agent: establishing the fundamental perception-action loop, scaling capabilities across diverse embodiments and environments, and finally ensuring trustworthy deployment-all supported by the essential data infrastructure. For each of them, we review existing approaches and highlight future opportunities.

Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) are particularly at risk, especially in urban environments where they are often occluded by parked vehicles or buildings. Autonomous Driving (AD) and Collective Perception (CP) are promising solutions to mitigate these risks. In particular, infrastructure-assisted CP, where sensor units are mounted on infrastructure elements such as traffic lights or lamp posts, can help overcome perceptual limitations by providing enhanced points of view, which significantly reduces occlusions. To encourage decision makers to adopt this technology, comprehensive studies and datasets demonstrating safety improvements for VRUs are essential. In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating the safety improvement by infrastructure-based CP specifically targeted at VRUs including a dataset with safety-critical EuroNCAP scenarios (CarlaNCAP) with 11k frames. Using this dataset, we conduct an in-depth simulation study and demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted CP can significantly reduce accident rates in safety-critical scenarios, achieving up to 100% accident avoidance compared to a vehicle equipped with sensors with only 33%.

Previous TAMP algorithms have focused mainly on computational performance, completeness, or optimality by making the problem tractable through simplifications and abstractions. However, this comes at the cost of the resulting plans potentially failing to account for the dynamics or complex contacts necessary to reliably perform the task when object manipulation is required. Additionally, approaches that ignore effects of the low-level controllers may not obtain optimal or feasible plan realizations for the real system. We investigate the use of a GPU-parallelized physics simulator to compute realizations of plans with motion controllers, explicitly accounting for dynamics, and considering contacts with the environment. Using cross-entropy optimization, we sample the parameters of the controllers, or actions, to obtain low-cost solutions. Since our approach uses the same controllers as the real system, the robot can directly execute the computed plans. We demonstrate our approach for a set of tasks where the robot is able to exploit the environment's geometry to move an object.

Although some studies have attempted to bridge this gap using reinforcement learning, they remain confined to merely reproducing human manipulation, resulting in limited task performance. In this paper, we propose UniBYD, a unified framework that uses a dynamic reinforcement learning algorithm to discover manipulation policies aligned with the robot's physical characteristics. To enable consistent modeling across diverse robotic hand morphologies, UniBYD incorporates a unified morphological representation (UMR). Building on UMR, we design a dynamic PPO with an annealed reward schedule, enabling reinforcement learning to transition from imitation of human demonstrations to explore policies adapted to diverse robotic morphologies better, thereby going beyond mere imitation of human hands. To address the frequent failures of learning human priors in the early training stage, we design a hybrid Markov-based shadow engine that enables reinforcement learning to imitate human manipulations in a fine-grained manner. To evaluate UniBYD comprehensively, we propose UniManip, the first benchmark encompassing robotic manipulation tasks spanning multiple hand morphologies. Experiments demonstrate a 67.90% improvement in success rate over the current state-of-the-art.

Classic Artificial Intelligence techniques for this purpose, focusing on symbolic approaches, have long-ago hit the scalability wall on compute and memory costs. Advances in Large Language Models in the past decade (neural approaches) have resulted in unprecedented displays of capability, at the cost of control, explainability, and interpretability. Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; however, they typically require substantially more comprehensive training and suffer from the same deficiencies in reliability. Here, we show it is possible to build competent Large Action Models by composing off-the-shelf foundation models, and that their control, interpretability, and explainability can be effected by incorporating symbolic wrappers and associated verification on their outputs, achieving verifiable neuro-symbolic solutions for intelligent robots. Our experiments on a multi-modal robot demonstrate that Large Action Model intelligence does not require massive end-to-end training, but can be achieved by integrating efficient perception models with a logic-driven core. We find that driving action execution through the generation of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) code enables a human-in-the-loop verification stage that effectively mitigates action hallucinations. These results can support practitioners in the design and development of robotic Large Action Models across novel industries, and shed light on the ongoing challenges that must be addressed to ensure safety in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff09\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6280\u672f\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u5305\u88c5\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff08PDDL\uff09\u4ee3\u7801\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6240\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes.

To address this, we propose ProbeMDE, a cost-aware active sensing framework that combines RGB images with sparse proprioceptive measurements for MDE. Our approach utilizes an ensemble of MDE models to predict dense depth maps conditioned on both RGB images and on a sparse set of known depth measurements obtained via proprioception, where the robot has touched the environment in a known configuration. We quantify predictive uncertainty via the ensemble's variance and measure the gradient of the uncertainty with respect to candidate measurement locations. To prevent mode collapse while selecting maximally informative locations to propriocept (touch), we leverage Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) over this gradient map. We validate our method in both simulated and physical experiments on central airway obstruction surgical phantoms. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods across standard depth estimation metrics, achieving higher accuracy while minimizing the number of required proprioceptive measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProbeMDE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5916\u79d1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProbeMDE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "ProbeMDE\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 RGB \u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We provide evidence in both simulation and the real world that this approach outperforms the common paradigm of training agents in isolation with rewards that prescribe behavior, e.g., progress on the raceline, in particular when the complexity of the environment increases, e.g., in the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we find that multi-agent competition yields policies that transfer more reliably to the real world than policies trained with a single-agent progress-based reward, despite the two methods using the same simulation environment, randomization strategy, and hardware. In addition to improved sim-to-real transfer, the multi-agent policies also exhibit some degree of generalization to opponents unseen at training time. Overall, our work, following in the tradition of multi-agent competitive game-play in digital domains, shows that sparse task-level rewards are sufficient for training agents capable of advanced low-level control in the physical world.\n  Code: https://github.com/Jirl-upenn/AgileFlight_MultiAgent", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ade\u4e89\u63d0\u9ad8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u9ad8\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u8d62\u5f97\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ade\u4e89\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3"}}

While generative models present an attractive solution, existing methods often alter only visual appearances without creating new behaviors, or suffer from embodiment inconsistencies that yield implausible motions. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorDream, an embodiment-aware world model that repurposes pretrained video diffusion models for robot data synthesis. AnchorDream conditions the diffusion process on robot motion renderings, anchoring the embodiment to prevent hallucination while synthesizing objects and environments consistent with the robot's kinematics. Starting from only a handful of human teleoperation demonstrations, our method scales them into large, diverse, high-quality datasets without requiring explicit environment modeling. Experiments show that the generated data leads to consistent improvements in downstream policy learning, with relative gains of 36.4% in simulator benchmarks and nearly double performance in real-world studies. These results suggest that grounding generative world models in robot motion provides a practical path toward scaling imitation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnchorDream\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u662f\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "AnchorDream\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u6e32\u67d3\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u8fbe\u523036.4%\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
