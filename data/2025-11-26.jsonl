Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in generating draft responses for clinicians, yet how physicians refine these drafts remains underexplored. We present a mixed-methods study with nine ophthalmologists answering 144 cataract surgery questions across three conditions: writing from scratch, directly editing LLM drafts, and instruction-based indirect editing. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that while LLM outputs were generally accurate, occasional errors and automation bias revealed the need for human oversight. Contextualization--adapting generic answers to local practices and patient expectations--emerged as a dominant form of editing. Editing workflows revealed trade-offs: indirect editing reduced effort but introduced errors, while direct editing ensured precision but with higher workload. We conclude with design and policy implications for building safe, scalable LLM-assisted clinical communication systems."}

Different application domains thereby impose different requirements. I.e., for some purposes it is vital that the data is based on a guided interaction process, meaning that monitored subjects pursued a given task, while other purposes require additional context information, such as widget interactions or metadata. Unfortunately, the amount of publicly available datasets is small and their respective applicability for specific purposes limited. We present GUIDEd Interaction DATA (GUIDAETA) - a new dataset, collected from a large-scale guided user study with more than 250 users, each working on three pre-defined information retrieval tasks using a custom-built consumer information system. Besides being larger than most comparable datasets - with 716 completed tasks, 2.39 million mouse and keyboard events (2.35 million and 40 thousand, respectively) and a total observation period of almost 50 hours - its interactions exhibit encompassing context information in the form of widget information, triggered (system) events and associated displayed content.

However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models."}

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side."}

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented.

Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance.

To address this gap, we propose a hybrid architecture where a single leader tracks a pre-computed, safe trajectory, which serves as a shared trajectory backup set for all follower agents.

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy."}

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods."}

To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost."}

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control."}

However, achieving robust and precise motion with strong force interaction remains a significant challenge. Based on the above limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning control framework that simultaneously optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy through coupled training under external force interaction environments. Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback. Moreover, HAFO employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic framework in which the Critic-network access to privileged spring-damping forces guides the actor-network to learn a generalizable, robust policy for resisting external disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves stable control of humanoid robot under various strong force interactions, showing remarkable performance in load tasks and ensuring stable robot operation under rope tension disturbances.

We introduce Dynamic-ICP, a Doppler-aware registration framework. The method (i) estimates ego motion from per-point Doppler velocity via robust regression and builds a velocity filter, (ii) clusters dynamic objects and reconstructs object-wise translational velocities from ego-compensated radial measurements, (iii) predicts dynamic points with a constant-velocity model, and (iv) aligns scans using a compact objective that combines point-to-plane geometry residual with a translation-invariant, rotation-only Doppler residual. The approach requires no external sensors or sensor-vehicle calibration and operates directly on FMCW LiDAR range and Doppler velocities. We evaluate Dynamic-ICP on three datasets-HeRCULES, HeLiPR, AevaScenes-focusing on highly dynamic scenes. Dynamic-ICP consistently improves rotational stability and translation accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is also simple to integrate into existing pipelines, runs in real time, and provides a lightweight solution for robust registration in dynamic environments.

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side."}

ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation. An Affordance Memory Bank continually accumulates successful execution episodes and propagates part-level actionable affordances to unseen articulated parts and configurations. Extensive experiments on ArtiBench show that our ArtiBrain significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization.

Rapid information gathering and comprehensive structural assessment of buildings have different requirements and therefore necessitate distinct methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel modular Next-Best-View (NBV) planning framework for aerial robots that explicitly uses a reconstruction quality objective to guide the exploration planning. In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments. We demonstrate that it successfully adjusts its behavior to the user goal while consistently outperforming conventional NBV strategies in terms of coverage, quality of the final 3D map and path efficiency."}

However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments."}

By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera.

This paper tackles this problem and allows to extend existing rigid-body pose estimation methods to non-rigid systems. Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties. We demonstrate this feasibility on a simple spring-camera system, and show how it robustly resolves the typically ill-posed problem of metric scale and gravity recovery in monocular visual odometry."}

However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants."}
