### [1] [Debate2Create: Robot Co-design via Large Language Model Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25850)
*Kevin Qiu,Marek Cygan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: D2C框架利用多智能体的辩论方式自动优化机器人的形态和控制，取得了显著的设计效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化机器人形态和控制的共同设计是一个长期以来的挑战，主要因为设计空间广泛且形体与行为之间紧密耦合。

Method: D2C引入了一个设计代理和控制代理，每轮由设计代理提出形态修改，控制代理制定相应的奖励功能，通过评审机构的反馈来指导设计改进。

Result: D2C框架通过结构化的辩论，使大型语言模型（LLM）代理共同优化机器人的设计和奖励机制，最终在四足行走基准中实现了一种能够旅行更远的机器人设计。

Conclusion: D2C表明，当与物理基础反馈相结合时，多智能体辩论是一种有前途的新模式，可以用于机器人设计的自动化。

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising
new paradigm for automated robot design.

### [2] [Risk-Aware Safety Filters with Poisson Safety Functions and Laplace Guidance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25913)
*Gilbert Bahati,Ryan M. Bena,Meg Wilkinson,Pol Mestres,Ryan K. Cosner,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种风险意识的安全过滤器，通过理解环境来保障机器人在真实世界中的安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人系统在真实环境中导航需要对环境进行语义理解，以正确判断安全行为。

Method: 通过解Dirichlet问题，对于Poisson方程和Laplace方程，生成安全函数和安全指导场，合并以定义安全约束。

Result: 开发了一种风险意识的安全过滤器，结合了安全函数和指导场以确保安全。

Conclusion: 通过将风险水平与障碍物特征关联，确保机器人的安全行为优先避开高风险障碍物。

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

### [3] [Curvature-Aware Calibration of Tactile Sensors for Accurate Force Estimation on Non-Planar Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25965)
*Luoyan Zhong,Heather Jin Hee Kim,Dylan P. Losey,Cara M. Nunez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究针对柔性触觉传感器在曲面上的校准问题，提出了一种神经网络模型，显著提升了力测量的准确性与一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的触觉传感器多只在平面上进行校准，导致在曲面上的应用准确性和一致性降低，因此需要开发新的校准方法以提升其实用性。

Method: 采用多层感知器神经网络，根据传感器的基线输出预测局部曲率，并在不同曲率的物体上进行验证。

Result: 开发了一种用于柔性触觉传感器的校准模型，提高了其在曲面上的力估计准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入曲率感知校准，柔性触觉传感器在实际应用中具备了更好的可靠性和精准度。

Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications
such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive
devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,
most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their
accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This
limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this
challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile
sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved
surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict
local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,
achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily
objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that
the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all
surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature
increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling
dependable performance across real-world applications.

### [4] [A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25985)
*Francisco M. F. R. Gonçalves,Ryan M. Bena,Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的姿态控制方法，通过优化姿态误差的控制，以保证唯一的闭环平衡，并在四旋翼的仿真和实际测试中显示出更好的飞行性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的四元数基础姿态控制方法在处理闭环平衡误差时存在不足，特别是在姿态误差较大的情况下。

Method: 通过引入新的姿态控制规律，利用姿态误差欧拉轴-角信息，构造严格的李雅甫诺夫函数进行分析。

Result: 采用新的控制规律后，独特的闭环平衡姿态误差四元数被保证，并且实现了统一渐近稳定性。通过数值仿真和小型四旋翼的实时测试证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的轴-角控制方法在稳定时间方面表现优越，超越了高性能的四元数控制器。

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

### [5] [DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004)
*Bai Li,Achilleas Kourtellis,Rong Cao,Joseph Post,Brian Porter,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DARTS是一种创新的无人机基础AI实时交通事故检测系统，具有高准确率和实时监测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速且可靠的事故检测对于降低与事故相关的死亡率、伤害和拥堵至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种名为DARTS的无人机基础AI实时交通事故检测系统。

Result: DARTS系统在自收集的数据集上实现99%的检测准确率，支持实时车辆轨迹提取和事故检测，还能进行在线可视化验证、严重性评估及事故造成的拥堵传播监测。

Conclusion: DARTS的灵活部署架构减少了对频繁实地巡逻的依赖，表明在资源匮乏的环境中具有潜在的可扩展性和成本效益，支持现代交通管理的运营效率和响应能力。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

### [6] [RADRON: Cooperative Localization of Ionizing Radiation Sources by MAVs with Compton Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26018)
*Petr Stibinger,Tomas Baca,Daniela Doubravova,Jan Rusnak,Jaroslav Solc,Jan Jakubek,Petr Stepan,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种通过协作的微型无人机利用康普顿相机实时定位放射性源的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为实现更高效的放射性物质定位，强调了轻量化探测器和MAVs的合作。

Method: 利用单探测器康普顿相机作为灵敏的小型辐射探测器，MAVs通过合作进行辐射源定位。

Result: 研究结果表明，系统能在稀疏的测量条件下实时估计辐射源位置，并能跟踪移动源。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的合作微型无人机（MAVs）能有效定位放射性物质，具有重要的应用前景。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

### [7] [Accelerating Real-World Overtaking in F1TENTH Racing Employing Reinforcement Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26040)
*Emily Steiner,Daniel van der Spuy,Futian Zhou,Afereti Pama,Minas Liarokapis,Henry Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 自主赛车在超车能力方面仍存在局限，本研究提出了一种新智能体，能够提高超车成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提高自主赛车在真实驾驶场景中超车能力的必要性，特别是在轮对轮赛车中。

Method: 在F1Tenth竞赛中部署智能体，针对不同对手进行训练，以学习并执行有效的超车策略。

Result: 开发出一种新型的赛车和超车智能体，在仿真和现实中都能可靠地完成超车。

Conclusion: 该智能体在F1Tenth车辆上经过训练后，超车成功率达87%，显示出与传统训练方法的显著提升。

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

### [8] [Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067)
*Chi Zhang,Mingrui Li,Wenzhe Tong,Xiaonan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合图神经网络的强化学习方法，有效提升了张紧结构机器人在现实环境中的运动控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决张紧结构机器人在运动控制中的挑战，改善其在动态下的学习能力。

Method: 引入一种形态感知的强化学习框架，在Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)算法中整合图神经网络 (GNN)。

Result: 在三种运动原型上（包括直线跟踪和双向转向）验证了方法，显示出优越的样本效率、对噪声和刚度变化的鲁棒性，以及改善的轨迹准确性。

Conclusion: 结合结构先验的强化学习方法在张紧结构机器人控制中展现出显著优势，且能够直接从仿真迁移到硬件。

Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
robot control.

### [9] [I don't Want You to Die: A Shared Responsibility Framework for Safeguarding Child-Robot Companionship](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26080)
*Fan Yang,Renkai Ma,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Lingyao Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 社交机器人的停用可能对儿童造成情感困扰，责任分配存在争议，建议建立责任框架以减轻影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交机器人与儿童之间的情感纽带在突然停用后造成的情感困扰和责任归属问题。

Method: 通过对72位美国参与者的定性调查，分析他们对机器人服务停用的看法及责任归属。

Result: 研究发现，责任被视为机器人公司、家长、开发者和政府之间的共同责任，但这种看法受政治意识形态和家长身份的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为儿童与机器人伴侣关系的责任框架提供实证支持，并讨论了如何通过设计和政策应对情感伤害。

Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
discontinuation.

### [10] [Beyond the Uncanny Valley: A Mixed-Method Investigation of Anthropomorphism in Protective Responses to Robot Abuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26082)
*Fan Yang,Lingyao Li,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Renkai Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 不同人形特征的机器人如何影响人类对其虐待的保护反应，发现中等人形机器人引发最强烈的道德关切与愤怒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人形特征如何影响人类对机器人虐待的道德反应，延伸CASA和冷漠谷理论。

Method: 实验研究，以视频展示不同人形特征的机器人遭受虐待，分析参与者的保护反应。

Result: 发现保护反应并非线性，具有中等人形特征的机器人引发强烈的生理愤怒表现，并且道德推理随着人形特征的增加而转变。

Conclusion: 冷漠谷效果并未减弱道德关切，反而促使更强烈的保护冲动，为机器人设计、政策及法律框架提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

### [11] [Embodied Intelligence for Advanced Bioinspired Microrobotics: Examples and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26132)
*Nestor O. Perez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何在微型机器人设计中融入体现智能（EI）原则，强调共设计的必要性及其在微型机器人中的实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨身体形态、材料特性、环境交互和控制策略如何融入机器人设计过程中，以生成智能行为，特别是在运动和导航方面。

Method: 通过展示作者及其团队在自主微型机器人实验室开发的多个机器人，阐明了EI作为设计原则的应用。

Result: 展示了一系列机器人（如Bee++、RoBeetle等），这些机器人表现出的智能行为源于其结构动态以及组件与环境之间的物理交互。

Conclusion: 共设计不仅是约束下的实证优化方法，还是促进体现智能的方式，提供了一种可扩展的、稳健的替代经典控制的方法，适用于毫米到厘米级的机器人。

Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

### [12] [Kinodynamic Task and Motion Planning using VLM-guided and Interleaved Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26139)
*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混合状态树的TAMP框架，通过结合符号和数值状态，提高了长时间跨度问题的成功率和降低了规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的任务与运动规划方法在长时间跨度问题上成本高昂，主要是由于过多的运动采样，而当前的大型语言模型（LLMs）缺乏三维空间推理能力，无法确保几何或动态可行性。

Method: 提出了一种基于混合状态树的运动与任务规划框架（TAMP），整合了符号与数值状态，在规划过程中同时进行任务和运动决策。

Result: 相比于传统和基于LLM的TAMP规划器，该框架在模拟域和现实世界的实验中显示出32.14%-1166.67%的平均成功率提升，并且在复杂问题上的规划时间减少，消融实验进一步突出了VLM指导的益处。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将运动规划器与物理模拟器相结合，验证了运动的动力学约束，并通过可视化状态引导TAMP解决方案的探索和回溯，从而显著提升任务与运动规划的效率和效果。

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

### [13] [Adaptive Trajectory Refinement for Optimization-based Local Planning in Narrow Passages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26142)
*Hahjin Lee,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适应性轨迹优化算法，显著提高了移动机器人在狭窄通道中的规划成功率和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在拥挤环境中规划轨迹仍然是一大挑战，传统方法常常失效或生成次优路径，因此需要一种新的算法以提高通过狭窄通道的成功率和效率。

Method: 算法分为两个阶段：第一阶段通过细分路径段执行保守的碰撞测试，消除碰撞风险；第二阶段基于渗透方向和线搜索进行姿态修正，确保所有姿态均为无碰撞状态。

Result: 本研究提出了一种适应性轨迹优化算法，用于在拥挤环境中为移动机器人规划轨迹，尤其是通过狭窄通道的挑战。通过两个主要阶段，确保在路径段和姿态水平上的安全性，算法展示了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 实验证明，所提方法使机器人能够安全通过狭窄的通道，同时保持快速的规划性能。

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

TL;DR: 本研究提出结合CNN与视觉变换器的新方法，提升了在动态障碍物环境下的自我定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实现自动驾驶中，利用便宜的单目摄像头进行3D地图自我定位是必要的，然而现有的基于CNN的方法在动态障碍物存在时表现不佳。

Method: 采用结合卷积神经网络和视觉变换器的混合方法，以提取局部和全局特征，从而提升自我定位性能。

Result: 该研究提出了一种结合CNN和视觉变换器（Vision Transformer）的方法，能够在有动态障碍物的情况下显著提升自我定位的精度。

Conclusion: 实验表明，与现有最先进方法相比，新方法在动态障碍物环境下的准确率提升达1.5倍，且在公共数据集上的自我定位误差比SOTA小20.1%。

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

TL;DR: PHUMA是一个新的人形 locomotion 数据集，通过处理物理伪影，提高了运动模仿的可靠性与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发人形机器人运动模仿能力，实现类人行为，但现有的数据集稀缺且昂贵，限制了可扩展性和多样性。

Method: PHUMA利用人类视频进行数据收集，通过严格的数据筛选和物理约束的重定向来消除伪影，确保关节限制和地面接触。

Result: PHUMA数据集通过大规模人类视频，克服了数据采集困难，并消除运动中的物理伪影。

Conclusion: 经过评估，PHUMA训练的策略在运动模仿和路径跟随中均优于Humanoid-X和AMASS，显著提高了多样性运动的模仿能力。

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

### [16] [Thor: Towards Human-Level Whole-Body Reactions for Intense Contact-Rich Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26280)
*Gangyang Li,Qing Shi,Youhao Hu,Jincheng Hu,Zhongyuan Wang,Xinlong Wang,Shaqi Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Thor是一个新的类人机器人框架，通过强化学习和力自适应奖励提升机器人在高接触强度环境中的适应性和力量表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类人机器人在与环境进行强接触交互时，如何产生类似人类的适应性反应这一主要挑战。

Method: 提出Thor框架，设计了力自适应躯干倾斜奖励函数，采用强化学习架构实现上下半身的解耦控制。

Result: Thor在力量交互任务中表现优异，最大后退拉动力为167.7 N，前进为145.5 N，分别比最优基线提升68.9%和74.7%。

Conclusion: Thor显著提升了类人机器人在接触丰富环境中的力交互能力。

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

*Mirko Usuelli,David Rapado-Rincon,Gert Kootstra,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM是一个结合视觉和激光雷达的SLAM框架，能够在果园中实现实时3D场景理解，克服复杂环境带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现自主机器人在果园中进行实时3D场景理解，以应对重复的行几何、季节性外观变化和风驱动的叶子运动。

Method: 结合直接LiDAR里程计和循环闭合与多摄像机3D高斯溅射渲染，使用统一的梯度驱动地图生命周期和概率LiDAR深度一致性引导位姿优化。

Result: AgriGS-SLAM在多个季节和地点的测试中，重建结果更清晰、更稳定，轨迹更平稳，超越了现有的3DGS-SLAM基线。

Conclusion: AgriGS-SLAM在果园监测中表现优越，能够实现更清晰稳定的重建和轨迹，且实时性能优良，适用于其他户外场景的多模态感知。

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的强化学习代理能够有效地自动化木材装载过程，达到94%的成功率，从而减轻操作员的工作压力。

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by
picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a
secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically
and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote
areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the
process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing
previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in
automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was
studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent
will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and
grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed.
To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in
NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario
were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning
approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of
reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The
agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position
and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

TL;DR: Hi-ORS 是一种后训练方法，通过拒绝采样提高了强化学习的稳定性和鲁棒性，在短时间内显著提升了机器人操作的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强强化学习（RL）在中间步骤阶段面临的价值估计不准确和稀疏监督问题，以及模仿学习（IL）由于离线特性导致的表现不足。

Method: 提出了一种使用拒绝采样的后训练方法，通过过滤负奖励样本和采用加权奖励的监督训练目标来实现训练稳定性与高度鲁棒性。

Result: 在三项真实任务和两个实现中，Hi-ORS 在仅1.5小时的真实世界训练内，通过微调pi-base策略，成功掌握了接触丰富的操控任务，并超过了强化学习和模仿学习的基准。

Conclusion: Hi-ORS 在短时间内显著提高了机器人操控的效果和效率，并表现出强大的测试时可扩展性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

Conclusion: RoboOS-NeXT在多种复杂协调任务中展现了卓越的性能，证明了其在多机器人协作中的有效性。

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

TL;DR: 通过新框架，机器人能更好地理解和使用工具，实现精确的操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规机器人在运动学理解方面有限，仅限于预编程任务，无法有效利用工具。

Method: 通过集成模拟学习的动作轨迹和工具，展示了从模拟到现实场景技能转移的可行性，并进行了全面实验验证。

Result: 提出一种新框架，扩展机器人逆运动学求解器的能力，实现对各种长度工具的顺序操作。

Conclusion: 该研究表明机器人在工具使用四个基本方面的潜在进展，使其掌握工具操作的复杂技能。

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉导航算法在不同平台和场景中性能差异显著，FLYINGTRUST提供了一个系统化的评估工具，旨在降低部署风险并提高算法性能的可靠性。

Method: FLYINGTRUST模型通过最大推重比和轴向最大角加速度两个指标来描述平台能力，并结合多样的场景库与真实及虚拟平台进行标准化评估和评分。

Result: FLYINGTRUST是一种高保真度、可配置的基准测试框架，旨在评估不同平台和场景几何对四旋翼视觉导航算法性能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，平台能力和场景几何对导航成功有可预测的影响，不同算法在不同条件下表现出不同的偏好和失败模式，为未来的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation
in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene
geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support
systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,
configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and
scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models
vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:
maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The
benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and
virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together
with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform
importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare
representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches
under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario
combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal
systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform
capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct
preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These
observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform
capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and
selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across
diverse platforms and scenarios.

Result: 这种新方法提高了滤波器的精度，并允许连续时间方法以超过实际时间的速度在线运行。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来连续机器人状态估计领域的研究提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

Motivation: 在机器人的Likelihood-Free推断中，支持的错误指定可能导致不理想但假装确定的后验分布。

Method: 提出三种启发式LFI变体（EDGE、MODE和CENTRE）来解决支持错误指定问题，适应性地整合支持和后验推理。

Result: 在动态可变线性物体（DLO）操控任务中，结果表明启发式支持自适应可以提高参数推断的精度，同时增强基于仿真的策略学习性能。

Conclusion: 通过使用更精确的后验分布作为领域分布，仿真策略学习能够实现更强大的面向对象的代理表现。

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

Conclusion: 混合一致性策略为机器人策略提供了一个实用的准确性和效率权衡，表明多模态性并不需要缓慢的推理过程。

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world
experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success
rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a

Conclusion: AR导航辅助工具能提高搜索任务的表现，但可能导致用户对物理环境的意识减弱，需注意潜在的不良影响。

Abstract: Head-worn augmented reality (AR) is a hotly pursued and increasingly feasible
contender paradigm for replacing or complementing smartphones and watches for
continual information consumption. Here, we compare three different AR
navigation aids (on-screen compass, on-screen radar and in-world vertical
arrows) in a wide-area outdoor user study (n=24) where participants search for
hidden virtual target items amongst physical and virtual objects. We analyzed
participants' search task performance, movements, eye-gaze, survey responses
and object recall. There were two key findings. First, all navigational aids
enhanced search performance relative to a control condition, with some benefit
and strongest user preference for in-world arrows. Second, users recalled fewer
physical objects than virtual objects in the environment, suggesting reduced
awareness of the physical environment. Together, these findings suggest that
while navigational aids presented in AR can enhance search task performance,
users may pay less attention to the physical environment, which could have
undesirable side-effects.

Conclusion: 人机协作在机器学习目标变量的实施中存在机会和风险，未来研究需进一步探索这些机会并减轻风险。

Abstract: Predictive modeling has the potential to enhance human decision-making.
However, many predictive models fail in practice due to problematic problem
formulation in cases where the prediction target is an abstract concept or
construct and practitioners need to define an appropriate target variable as a
proxy to operationalize the construct of interest. The choice of an appropriate
proxy target variable is rarely self-evident in practice, requiring both domain
knowledge and iterative data modeling. This process is inherently
collaborative, involving both domain experts and data scientists. In this work,
we explore how human-machine teaming can support this process by accelerating
iterations while preserving human judgment. We study the impact of two
human-machine teaming strategies on proxy construction: 1) relevance-first:
humans leading the process by selecting relevant proxies, and 2)
performance-first: machines leading the process by recommending proxies based
on predictive performance. Based on a controlled user study of a proxy
construction task (N = 20), we show that the performance-first strategy
facilitated faster iterations and decision-making, but also biased users
towards well-performing proxies that are misaligned with the application goal.
Our study highlights the opportunities and risks of human-machine teaming in
operationalizing machine learning target variables, yielding insights for
future research to explore the opportunities and mitigate the risks.

TL;DR: 增强现实的虚拟路径引导和视觉杂乱度影响用户在物理环境中的搜索表现和物体记忆，提示需在AR应用设计中考虑这些因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究增强现实（AR）对用户在实际环境中导航时的感知需求及其影响，以提高用户效果和安全性。

Method: 通过让参与者在预定义路径上行走，搜索物理或虚拟物体，控制增强密度和行走方式，分析其对搜索任务表现和物体回忆的影响。

Result: 虚拟路径引导和增强密度对搜索表现和记忆有显著影响，用户对物理和虚拟物体的注意力存在差异。

Conclusion: 根据研究结果，我们为用于移动场景的增强现实应用提出了设计建议。

Abstract: Augmented reality is projected to be a primary mode of information
consumption on the go, seamlessly integrating virtual content into the physical
world. However, the potential perceptual demands of viewing virtual annotations
while navigating a physical environment could impact user efficacy and safety,
and the implications of these demands are not well understood. Here, we
investigate the impact of virtual path guidance and augmentation density
(visual clutter) on search performance and memory. Participants walked along a
predefined path, searching for physical or virtual items. They experienced two
levels of augmentation density, and either walked freely or with enforced speed
and path guidance. Augmentation density impacted behavior and reduced awareness
of uncommon objects in the environment. Analysis of search task performance and
post-experiment item recall revealed differing attention to physical and
virtual objects. On the basis of these findings we outline considerations for
AR apps designed for use on the go.

TL;DR: 研究表明，尽管BLV用户对全自动车辆初始信任较高，但他们在乘坐过程中需要更多的交互信息，不同的交流方式也需重新评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索盲人和低视力者（BLV）在全自动车辆（FAV）中的互动需求。

Method: 通过六个路面测试和实验室焦点小组研究方式，收集16名参与者的经验和意见。

Result: 发现BLV参与者在使用FAV时需要分层的、有价值的信息，以培养对FAV的信任。

Conclusion: 设计FAV时需关注尊重和价值敏感性的交互，以解决BLV用户的出行挑战，并维护他们的尊严。

Abstract: Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) hold promise for enhancing the mobility of
blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To understand the situated interaction
needs of BLV passengers, we conducted six on-road, and in-lab focus groups with
16 participants, immersing them in real-world driving conditions. Our thematic
analysis reveals that BLV participants express a high initial 'faith' in FAVs,
but require layered, value-sensitive information during the ride to cultivate
trust. The participants' modality preference for voice suggests re-evaluating
the role of haptics for BLV users in FAVs. Our findings show the importance of
a respectful interaction design in FAVs that both address BLV users' mobility
challenges and uphold their dignity. While others have advocated for a dignity
lens, our contribution lies in grounding this framework in empirical findings
and unpacking what it means to design for dignity in the context of FAVs.

Result: 试点反馈显示FractalBrain对正念练习和注意力增强有潜力。

Conclusion: FractalBrain系统能够促进正念练习并增强注意力，产生个性化的沉浸体验。

Abstract: Mindfulness has been studied and practiced in enhancing psychological
well-being while reducing neuroticism and psychopathological indicators.
However, practicing mindfulness with continuous attention is challenging,
especially for beginners. In the proposed system, FractalBrain, we utilize an
interactive audiovisual fractal with a geometric repetitive pattern that has
been demonstrated to induce meditative effects. FractalBrain presents an
experience combining a surreal virtual reality (VR) program with an
electroencephalogram (EEG) interface. While viewing an ever-changing
fractal-inspired artwork in an immersive environment, the user's EEG stream is
analyzed and mapped into VR. These EEG data adaptively manipulates the
audiovisual parameters in real-time, generating a distinct experience for each
user. The pilot feedback suggests the potential of the FractalBrain to
facilitate mindfulness and enhance attention.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了交互增强指令（IAI）模型，以促进文本提示与GUI交互的有效整合，从而改善人类与生成性AI之间的通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本提示方式难以传达细粒度和指向性的意图，缺乏将其与GUI交互结合的正式模型。

Method: 通过迭代和推理的过程，开发了IAI模型，并从以往工具中提炼出十二种原子交互范式。

Result: IAI模型验证了其在设计特征描述、比较和示例研究中的有效性，展示了其在未来GenAI系统中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: IAI模型能够系统性地描述和比较交互与文本提示的组合，促进未来生成性AI系统的设计创新。

Abstract: Text prompt is the most common way for human-generative AI (GenAI)
communication. Though convenient, it is challenging to convey fine-grained and
referential intent. One promising solution is to combine text prompts with
precise GUI interactions, like brushing and clicking. However, there lacks a
formal model to model synergistic designs between prompts and interactions,
hindering their comparison and innovation. To fill this gap, via an iterative
and deductive process, we develop the Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI)
model, a compact entity-relation graph formalizing how the combination of
interactions and text prompts enhances human-generative AI communication. With
the model, we distill twelve recurring and composable atomic interaction
paradigms from prior tools, verifying our model's capability to facilitate
systematic design characterization and comparison. Case studies further
demonstrate the model's utility in applying, refining, and extending these
paradigms. These results illustrate our IAI model's descriptive,
discriminative, and generative power for shaping future GenAI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出SIA系统，旨在通过协调代理流程处理社交媒体中的异构多模态数据，支持人机合作，并有效发现有意义的洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深入理解社交媒体分析中的复杂现象，如舆论动态和信息扩散，传统方法无法充分处理异构数据，急需新的方法论。

Method: 提出SIA系统，通过协调的代理流程连接异构多模态数据，以实现一致的数据流和透明的工作流程。

Result: SIA系统通过专家中心案例研究和定量评估，展示了其在社交媒体分析中的有效性，能够生成丰富的洞察。

Conclusion: SIA（社交洞察代理）系统能够有效地发现社交媒体中的多样且有意义的洞察，同时支持人类和代理在复杂分析任务中的合作。

Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data,
capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network
structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as
opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However,
discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually
challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization.
Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language
models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot
adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA
(Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous
multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral
data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization
artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy
that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,
SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure
multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies
tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive
interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and
refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.
Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that
SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media
while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.

Motivation: 探究虚拟头像外观如何影响其适用性及用户体验，特别是在医疗应用场景中

Method: 分析六种不同特征虚拟头像与用户偏好的互动

Result: 结果表明，能力是头像选择中最关键的因素，而人性化对健康数据共享的影响微乎其微。性别对评分没有显著影响，但服装风格却起到了关键角色。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了医疗应用中虚拟头像设计的重要性，以提升用户体验和参与度。

Abstract: The appearance of a virtual avatar significantly influences its perceived
appropriateness and the user's experience, particularly in healthcare
applications. This study analyzed interactions with six avatars of varying
characteristics in a patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) application to
investigate correlations between avatar ratings and user preferences.
Forty-seven participants completed a healthcare survey involving 30 PROMIS
items (Global Health and Physical Function) and then rated the avatars on
warmth, competence, attractiveness, and human-likeness, as well as their
willingness to share personal data. The results showed that competence was the
most critical factor in avatar selection, while human-likeness had minimal
impact on health data disclosure. Gender did not significantly affect the
ratings, but clothing style played a key role, with male avatars in
professional attire rated higher in competence due to gender-stereotypical
expectations. In contrast, professional female avatars were rated lower in
warmth and attractiveness. These findings underline the importance of
thoughtful avatar design in healthcare applications to enhance user experience
and engagement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望解决用户在虚拟环境中导航时，如何在物理空间限制内实现更自然的行走体验。

Method: 在用户视野中放置干扰物，并根据用户对干扰物的注意力动态调整翻译增益，用于评估其在虚拟环境中的效果。

Result: 提出了一种基于视觉干扰物动态调整平移增益的新方法，显著提高了用户的平移增益阈值。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了平移增益阈值，同时保持用户的舒适性和接受度，适用于重定向行走系统。

Abstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to
allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined
physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are
distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values.
However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively
measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts
translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within
the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their
attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on
the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process
remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task
oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing
distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation
gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method
maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW
systems.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个角色引导的大语言模型环境，评估不同思维角色对创造力支持的影响，结果表明个性化角色指导有助于平衡探索与收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在创造性工作和解决问题中日益重要，但先前研究表明，它们可能会削弱无辅助创造力。

Method: 通过控制实验评估用户行为，参与者与两种角色（发散思维和收敛思维）进行互动，控制组则与提供直接答案的标准大语言模型互动。

Result: 用户对哪种角色更好地支持其创造力的认知与客观表现测量之间常常存在差异；个性特征分析显示，个体差异能够预测人们何时利用发散或收敛角色，交互模式反映了设计思维模型。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果为创造力支持系统提供了设计原则，通过基于角色的指导和个性化实现探索与收敛之间的平衡。这些见解推动了人机协作工具的发展，旨在辅助而非压制人类创造力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping creative work and
problem-solving; however, prior research suggests that they may diminish
unassisted creativity. To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment
was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two
complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through
a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona,
while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers.
  Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity
often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses
revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent
versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing.
Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model,
demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving.
  Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that
strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based
guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration
tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解信心如何影响用户在与生成AI互动时的决策与建议的依赖性。

Method: 研究通过两个实验探讨用户在寻求和依赖GenAI建议过程中的自信变化，以及建议对自信的影响。

Result: 寻求和依赖GenAI建议使用户对自身和GenAI的信心增加，但有时会忽视关键信息。

Conclusion: 用户对自身和GenAI的自信在互动中起着重要作用，且建议的依赖性会增强对GenAI和自身的自信。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can aid humans in a wide range of
tasks, but its effectiveness critically depends on users being able to evaluate
the accuracy of GenAI outputs and their own expertise. Here we asked how
confidence in self and GenAI contributes to decisions to seek and rely on
advice from GenAI ('prospective confidence'), and how advice-taking in turn
shapes this confidence ('retrospective confidence'). In a novel paradigm
involving text generation, participants formulated plans for events, and could
request advice from a GenAI (Study 1; N=200) or were randomly assigned to
receive advice (Study 2; N=300), which they could rely on or ignore. Advice
requests in Study 1 were related to higher prospective confidence in GenAI and
lower confidence in self. Advice-seekers showed increased retrospective
confidence in GenAI, while those who declined advice showed increased
confidence in self. Random assignment in Study 2 revealed that advice exposure
increases confidence in GenAI and in self, suggesting that GenAI advice-taking
causally boosts retrospective confidence. These results were mirrored in advice
reliance, operationalised as the textual similarity between GenAI advice and
participants' responses, with reliance associated with increased retrospective
confidence in both GenAI and self. Critically, participants who chose to
obtain/rely on advice provided more detailed responses (likely due to the
output's verbosity), but failed to check the output thoroughly, missing key
information. These findings underscore a key role for confidence in
interactions with GenAI, shaped by both prior beliefs about oneself and the
reliability of AI, and context-dependent exposure to advice.
