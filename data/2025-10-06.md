### [1] [Vector Autoregression (VAR) of Longitudinal Sleep and Self-report Mood Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02511)
*Jeff Brozena*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析四年Oura环睡眠数据及情绪记录，发现夜间睡眠质量与抑郁和焦虑情绪存在因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索慢性疾病的长期自我管理中，自我追踪行为的重要性，特别是在健康相关数据收集不断改善的背景下。

Method: 采用向量自回归(VAR)模型和格兰杰因果性检验，分析了四年的睡眠和情绪数据。

Result: 通过VAR(2)模型，发现Oura环的睡眠质量评分影响抑郁和焦虑情绪。

Conclusion: Oura环的夜间睡眠质量评分被证明对抑郁和焦虑情绪存在格兰杰因果关系。

Abstract: Self-tracking is one of many behaviors involved in the long-term
self-management of chronic illnesses. As consumer-grade wearable sensors have
made the collection of health-related behaviors commonplace, the quality,
volume, and availability of such data has dramatically improved. This
exploratory longitudinal N-of-1 study quantitatively assesses four years of
sleep data captured via the Oura Ring, a consumer-grade sleep tracking device,
along with self-reported mood data logged using eMood Tracker for iOS. After
assessing the data for stationarity and computing the appropriate lag-length
selection, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model was fit along with Granger
causality tests to assess causal mechanisms within this multivariate time
series. Oura's nightly sleep quality score was shown to Granger-cause the
presence of depressed and anxious moods using a VAR(2) model.

### [2] [Open WebUI: An Open, Extensible, and Usable Interface for AI Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02546)
*Jaeryang Baek,Ayana Hussain,Danny Liu,Nicholas Vincent,Lawrence H. Kim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种开放且可扩展的LLM接口工具包，旨在提升用户与多个模型的互动体验，并通过用户调查和社交平台分析评估其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM接口在协作扩展和现实世界评估方面支持有限，用户在与多个模型互动和定制工作流时面临挑战。

Method: 分析社交平台的自然参与，进行用户调查，并提供工具包在实际中的典型示例。

Result: 提出了一种开放、可扩展且易用的LLM接口工具包，支持插件和与多个模型的交互。

Conclusion: 通过研究用户与工具包的互动与扩展，我们表明可扩展、开放的LLM界面提供了功能和社交价值，同时强调了未来HCI工作的机会。

Abstract: While LLMs enable a range of AI applications, interacting with multiple
models and customizing workflows can be challenging, and existing LLM
interfaces offer limited support for collaborative extension or real-world
evaluation. In this work, we present an interface toolkit for LLMs designed to
be open (open-source and local), extensible (plugin support and users can
interact with multiple models), and usable. The extensibility is enabled
through a two-pronged plugin architecture and a community platform for sharing,
importing, and adapting extensions. To evaluate the system, we analyzed organic
engagement through social platforms, conducted a user survey, and provided
notable examples of the toolkit in the wild. Through studying how users engage
with and extend the toolkit, we show how extensible, open LLM interfaces
provide both functional and social value, and highlight opportunities for
future HCI work on designing LLM toolkit platforms and shaping local LLM-user
interaction.

### [3] [When Researchers Say Mental Model/Theory of Mind of AI, What Are They Really Talking About?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02660)
*Xiaoyun Yin,Elmira Zahmat Doost,Shiwen Zhou,Garima Arya Yadav,Jamie C. Gorman*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文认为，AI系统的行为预测并不真正等同于人类的理论心智，呼吁在研究中关注人类与AI的相互作用及其共同的理论心智框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨目前关于AI是否具备理论心智的讨论，指出存在混淆模式匹配与真实认知的问题。

Method: 分析当前关于AI系统的理论心智（ToM）讨论，强调行为模仿与真正认知之间的区别。

Result: 呼吁重新审视测试AI的方式，认为现有使用人类认知测验的方法可能存在缺陷。

Conclusion: 应当转向关注人类与AI互动中的共同理论心智框架，强调相互作用，而不是孤立测试AI。

Abstract: When researchers claim AI systems possess ToM or mental models, they are
fundamentally discussing behavioral predictions and bias corrections rather
than genuine mental states. This position paper argues that the current
discourse conflates sophisticated pattern matching with authentic cognition,
missing a crucial distinction between simulation and experience. While recent
studies show LLMs achieving human-level performance on ToM laboratory tasks,
these results are based only on behavioral mimicry. More importantly, the
entire testing paradigm may be flawed in applying individual human cognitive
tests to AI systems, but assessing human cognition directly in the moment of
human-AI interaction. I suggest shifting focus toward mutual ToM frameworks
that acknowledge the simultaneous contributions of human cognition and AI
algorithms, emphasizing the interaction dynamics, instead of testing AI in
isolation.

### [4] ["It Felt Real" Victim Perspectives on Platform Design and Longer-Running Scams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02680)
*Jingjia Xiao,Qing Xiao,Hong Shen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了数字平台设计对长时间运行诈骗的影响，发现特定设计使诈骗者能更有效地欺骗受害者，并提出了未来平台的改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关注平台设计如何促成长时间运行的诈骗，填补现有研究中的空白。

Method: 对25名在中国的长时间运行诈骗受害者进行了深入访谈。

Result: 发现诈骗者如何策略性地利用平台特性建立可信度、策划亲密关系并维持与受害者的强制关系。

Conclusion: 平台设计可以被利用来支持长时间运行的诈骗，未来平台应进行重设计以更好地保护用户。

Abstract: Longer-running scams, such as romance fraud and "pig-butchering" scams,
exploit not only victims' emotions but also the design of digital platforms.
Scammers commonly leverage features such as professional-looking profile
verification, algorithmic recommendations that reinforce contact, integrated
payment systems, and private chat affordances to gradually establish trust and
dependency with victims. Prior work in HCI and criminology has examined online
scams through the lenses of detection mechanisms, threat modeling, and
user-level vulnerabilities. However, less attention has been paid to how
platform design itself enables longer-running scams. To address this gap, we
conducted in-depth interviews with 25 longer-running scam victims in China. Our
findings show how scammers strategically use platform affordances to stage
credibility, orchestrate intimacy, and sustain coercion with victims. By
analyzing scams as socio-technical projects, we highlight how platform design
can be exploited in longer-running scams, and point to redesigning future
platforms to better protect users.

### [5] [Prototyping Digital Social Spaces through Metaphor-Driven Design: Translating Spatial Concepts into an Interactive Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02759)
*Yoojin Hong,Martina Di Paola,Braahmi Padmakumar,Hwi Joon Lee,Mahnoor Shafiq,Joseph Seering*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种隐喻驱动的系统，帮助用户探索新的社交媒体环境，发现用户隐喻有助于表达社交期望，且模拟真实性受多重动态影响，最终强调隐喻作为设计工具的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的设计主要集中在参与度和规模上，而用户对在线空间有替代性的想法，难以在平台限制内进行原型设计。

Method: 一种隐喻驱动的系统，通过将用户的隐喻转化为结构化平台特性，生成带有大型语言模型（LLM）驱动代理的互动模拟。

Result: 研究表明，隐喻使用户能够表达不同的社交期望，并且模拟的真实性取决于其能否捕捉亲密性、参与性和时间参与等动态特征。

Conclusion: 隐喻驱动的模拟可以成为强大的设计工具，用于原型设计替代性的社交架构，拓宽未来社交平台的设计空间。

Abstract: Social media platforms are central to communication, yet their designs remain
narrowly focused on engagement and scale. While researchers have proposed
alternative visions for online spaces, these ideas are difficult to prototype
within platform constraints. In this paper, we introduce a metaphor-driven
system to help users imagine and explore new social media environments. The
system translates users' metaphors into structured sets of platform features
and generates interactive simulations populated with LLM-driven agents. To
evaluate this approach, we conducted a study where participants created and
interacted with simulated social media spaces. Our findings show that metaphors
allow users to express distinct social expectations, and that perceived
authenticity of the simulation depended on how well it captured dynamics like
intimacy, participation, and temporal engagement. We conclude by discussing how
metaphor-driven simulation can be a powerful design tool for prototyping
alternative social architectures and expanding the design space for future
social platforms.

### [6] [Fostering Collective Discourse: A Distributed Role-Based Approach to Online News Commenting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02766)
*Yoojin Hong,Yersultan Doszhan,Joseph Seering*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种新的新闻评论系统，通过分配角色促进平衡讨论，结果显示出更加均衡的观点但论点强度降低，表明设计中存在包容性与深度的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻评论系统基于个体主义假设，导致话题分散与极化，无法有效代表公众讨论的广度。

Method: 采用了混合方法的内部对照评估，参与者数量为38。

Result: 该系统支持理解问题、协作结构评论和建立讨论的三个参与阶段，用户评论显示出更均衡的观点和更中立的情感表达。

Conclusion: 我们提出的新闻评论系统促进了更均衡的讨论，但在论点强度与包容性之间存在权衡。

Abstract: Current news commenting systems are designed based on implicitly
individualistic assumptions, where discussion is the result of a series of
disconnected opinions. This often results in fragmented and polarized
conversations that fail to represent the spectrum of public discourse. In this
work, we develop a news commenting system where users take on distributed roles
to collaboratively structure the comments to encourage a connected, balanced
discussion space. Through a within-subject, mixed-methods evaluation (N=38), we
find that the system supported three stages of participation: understanding
issues, collaboratively structuring comments, and building a discussion. With
our system, users' comments displayed more balanced perspectives and a more
emotionally neutral argumentation. Simultaneously, we observed reduced argument
strength compared to a traditional commenting system, indicating a trade-off
between inclusivity and depth. We conclude with design considerations and
trade-offs for introducing distributed roles in news commenting system design.

### [7] [PromptMap: Supporting Exploratory Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02814)
*Yuhan Guo,Xingyou Liu,Xiaoru Yuan,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 为支持创意任务，我们提出基于Design-Exploration模型的PromptMap系统，通过可视化和交互改善文本到图像生成的探索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在创意任务中非常有价值，但用户在探索设计空间时容易迷失。

Method: 使用用户访谈评估系统效果，基于Design-Exploration模型创建交互式可视化系统

Result: PromptMap系统采用新的可视化表示和互动方式，帮助用户更好地组织和理解设计可能性。

Conclusion: 我们提出的PromptMap系统通过增强视觉表现和直观交互，改善了用户在文本到图像生成中的探索体验。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models can be tremendously valuable in supporting
creative tasks by providing inspirations and enabling quick exploration of
different design ideas. However, one common challenge is that users may still
not be able to find anything useful after many hours and hundreds of images.
Without effective help, users can easily get lost in the vast design space,
forgetting what has been tried and what has not. In this work, we first propose
the Design-Exploration model to formalize the exploration process. Based on
this model, we create an interactive visualization system, PromptMap, to
support exploratory text-to-image generation. Our system provides a new visual
representation that better matches the non-linear nature of such processes,
making them easier to understand and follow. It utilizes novel visual
representations and intuitive interactions to help users structure the many
possibilities that they can explore. We evaluated the system through in-depth
interviews with users.

### [8] [VR as a "Drop-In" Well-being Tool for Knowledge Workers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02836)
*Sophia Ppali,Haris Psallidopoulos,Marios Constantinides,Fotis Liarokapis*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究开发了Tranquil Loom应用，提供多种VR福祉活动，结果表明其在提升正念和减轻焦虑方面有效，同时强调了VR作为灵活的福祉支持工具的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究探索了VR如何满足知识工作者多样的身心需求，提供比单一活动或目标更全面的介入方式。

Method: 进行了两阶段的混合方法研究：首先访谈10名知识工作者以指导应用设计，其次与35名参与者部署应用，收集使用数据和福祉测量，并进行了访谈。

Result: 研究结果显示，使用者的正念水平提高，焦虑有所减少，参与者对结构性和开放性活动均表示喜爱，并在使用应用时常带有玩乐的心态。虽然AI建议使用不频繁，但激发了未来个性化的想法。

Conclusion: 整体参与者认为VR在提供情境性的、非处方的福祉支持方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used to support workplace
well-being, but many interventions focus narrowly on a single activity or goal.
Our work explores how VR can meet the diverse physical and mental needs of
knowledge workers. We developed Tranquil Loom, a VR app offering stretching,
guided meditation, and open exploration across four environments. The app
includes an AI assistant that suggests activities based on users' emotional
states. We conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study: (1) interviews with 10
knowledge workers to guide the app's design, and (2) deployment with 35
participants gathering usage data, well-being measures, and interviews. Results
showed increases in mindfulness and reductions in anxiety. Participants enjoyed
both structured and open-ended activities, often using the app playfully. While
AI suggestions were used infrequently, they prompted ideas for future
personalization. Overall, participants viewed VR as a flexible, ``drop-in''
tool, highlighting its value for situational rather than prescriptive
well-being support.

### [9] [ERUPT: An Open Toolkit for Interfacing with Robot Motion Planners in Extended Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02464)
*Isaac Ngui,Courtney McBeth,André Santos,Grace He,Katherine J. Mimnaugh,James D. Motes,Luciano Soares,Marco Morales,Nancy M. Amato*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ERUPT是一个XR系统，提升了机器人路径规划的交互性与可视化，允许用户实时修改环境并减少碰撞风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提升用户在机器人路径规划时的空间理解与交互能力。

Method: 通过在增强现实系统中集成MoveIt操作规划框架，实现用户动态环境重构和路径规划。

Result: ERUPT系统支持用户在沉浸式XR环境中调整对象，并能安全可视化机器人运动，确保路径的合理性。

Conclusion: ERUPT能够提升用户在机器人路径规划中的交互体验，并提供虚拟和现实世界的无缝连接。

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the
scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates
with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired
behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions
within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in
the real world.

### [10] [SIMSplat: Predictive Driving Scene Editing with Language-aligned 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02469)
*Sung-Yeon Park,Adam Lee,Juanwu Lu,Can Cui,Luyang Jiang,Rohit Gupta,Kyungtae Han,Ahmadreza Moradipari,Ziran Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SIMSplat是一种基于语言的驾驶场景编辑器，通过自然语言提示实现灵活的场景编辑，并且通过多种智能体的运动预测生成细致的物体交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有驾驶场景编辑方法下的限制，提高现实场景生成的效率与灵活性。

Method: 提出了一种语言对齐的高斯点云方法，将自然语言与驾驶场景编辑结合，支持对象直接查询与修改。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上的实验结果表明，SIMSplat在多种场景中展现了广泛的编辑能力与适应性。

Conclusion: SIMSplat展示了在驾驶场景中进行高效与精确编辑的能力，能够生成逼真的驾驶场景和交互。

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

### [11] [U-LAG: Uncertainty-Aware, Lag-Adaptive Goal Retargeting for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02526)
*Anamika J H,Anujith Muraleedharan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出 U-LAG 和 UAR-PF 作为应对变化环境中感知延迟和不确定性的解决方案，提高了机器人操作的成功率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不断变化的环境中，机器人需要应对延迟、噪声或过时的感知信息，以实现稳定的操控。

Method: 提出 U-LAG 和 UAR-PF，通过在感知和控制之间引入可插拔的目标重新瞄准模块，动态调整任务目标。

Result: 在 0-10 cm 的位移和 0-400 ms 的延迟下，UAR-PF 展示出相对于无重定向基线更高的成功率，且操作更加稳定，减少了任务中断的次数。

Conclusion: UAR-PF 提供了有效的目标重新瞄准能力，能够在感知延迟和不确定性条件下提高机器人操控的成功率。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

### [12] [A Recipe for Efficient Sim-to-Real Transfer in Manipulation with Online Imitation-Pretrained World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02538)
*Yilin Wang,Shangzhe Li,Haoyi Niu,Zhiao Huang,Weitong Zhang,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于世界模型的框架，通过在线模仿学习和离线微调，提高了模仿学习在数据有限情况下的表现，有效提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模仿学习中真实专家数据有限的问题，克服现有离线模仿方法的数据覆盖不足及性能下降。

Method: 基于世界模型的仿真到现实框架，结合了在线模仿预训练和离线微调。

Result: 通过在线交互，增强模型的健壮性，离线微调时的性能下降减少，提升跨领域的泛化能力。实验结果显示，相比现有离线模仿学习基准，成功率提升至少31.7%（仿真到仿真）和23.3%（仿真到现实）。

Conclusion: 该方法在仿真到仿真以及仿真到现实的转移中成功率提高，效果显著。

Abstract: We are interested in solving the problem of imitation learning with a limited
amount of real-world expert data. Existing offline imitation methods often
struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose
a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation
learning. Our sim-to-real framework is based on world models and combines
online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online
interactions, our approach alleviates the data coverage limitations of offline
methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation
during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at
least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over
existing offline imitation learning baselines.

### [13] [Efficient Optimal Path Planning in Dynamic Environments Using Koopman MPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02584)
*Mohammad Abtahi,Navid Mojahed,Shima Nazari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于双线性Koopman理论的数据驱动模型预测控制框架，可提高移动机器人在动态环境中的路径规划效率，特别是在处理非线性动态和避碰约束时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个数据驱动的模型预测控制框架，帮助移动机器人在动态环境中导航，解决非线性机器人动力学和避碰约束的路径规划问题。

Method: 采用扩展动态模式分解，从输入-状态数据中识别线性和双线性Koopman实现，并在模型预测控制框架中形成一个二次规划以解决移动障碍物下的路径规划问题。

Result: 本方法在面对移动障碍物时，能够以320倍的速度找到安全的最优行动，相比于在原始状态空间上求解路径规划问题的非线性MPC，具有显著的计算效率。

Conclusion: 双线性Koopman实现可以有效线性化高度非线性的最优控制问题，在考虑非线性状态和输入约束时，能够达到类似于线性问题的计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

### [14] [SubSense: VR-Haptic and Motor Feedback for Immersive Control in Subsea Telerobotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02594)
*Ruo Chen,David Blow,Adnan Abdullah,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合触觉反馈和虚拟现实的遥控潜水器操作新框架，显著提升了操作体验和任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的遥控潜水器操作缺乏沉浸感和感官反馈，影响了在复杂水下环境中的情况意识。

Method: 提出了SubSense框架，该框架结合了非侵入式触觉反馈接口和虚拟现实平台，提升了遥操作的交互性和有效性。

Result: 通过全面实验和用户研究，验证了系统的有效性，特别是在精细操作任务中相较于传统遥操作接口表现更佳。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著改善了遥控潜水器的操作体验，特别是在复杂的水下环境中提供了更好的遥感意识和任务表现。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

### [15] [UMI-on-Air: Embodiment-Aware Guidance for Embodiment-Agnostic Visuomotor Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02614)
*Harsh Gupta,Xiaofeng Guo,Huy Ha,Chuer Pan,Muqing Cao,Dongjae Lee,Sebastian Sherer,Shuran Song,Guanya Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UMI-on-Air框架通过结合高层次策略和低层次控制器，成功提高了空中操控任务的成功率和适应性，具有在不同环境中部署的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对机器人实施操作时控制和机器人动力学的不匹配问题，提出了一种新的方法以提高机器人在各种约束环境下的操控能力。

Method: 通过将高层次UMI策略与低层次的实体特定控制器结合使用，利用控制器的跟踪成本的梯度反馈来引导轨迹生成，从而实现适应性轨迹调整。

Result: 在多个长时间和高精度的空中操控任务中，EADP方法相比于无指导的扩散基线展示了更高的成功率、效率和鲁棒性，尤其是在遇到扰动时。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的UMI-on-Air框架显著提高了在动态和高精度空中操控任务中的成功率和效率，并能够适应不同的机器人实体，展示了其在多变环境中的适用性。

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

### [16] [RSV-SLAM: Toward Real-Time Semantic Visual SLAM in Indoor Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02616)
*Mobin Habibpour,Alireza Nemati,Ali Meghdari,Alireza Taheri,Shima Nazari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对动态环境的实时语义RGBD SLAM方法，通过深度学习和扩展卡尔曼滤波器有效识别动态对象，提升了SLAM系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现有的视觉SLAM方法假设世界是静态的，但在动态环境中表现不佳，因此提出了针对该问题的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种实时语义RGBD SLAM方法，结合深度学习语义信息、扩展卡尔曼滤波器和生成网络。

Result: 在TUM数据集中进行的基准测试显示，提出的方法在动态序列中的定位误差与最新的方法相当，同时实现接近实时的处理。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在动态环境中实现了有效的语义RGBD SLAM，提供了竞争力的定位精度并具备实时性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can

Motivation: 本文的动机来自于一个关键的故障场景，在该场景中，系统可能会经历其动态的突然变化。

Method: 算法首先对当前状态进行小幅扰动，以局部学习系统动态，然后计算可证明可达的状态集合及其对应的最大增长率界限，最后合成适当的控制动作，使系统到达一个可保证可达的状态。

Result: 证明了即使在未了解系统动态的情况下，依然可以跟踪一系列经分析证明可达的状态节点。

Conclusion: 该算法能够在不提前了解系统动态的情况下，精确驱动系统沿分段线性轨迹行进。

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的轨迹生成框架，以解决现有数据集的长尾分布问题，增强场景密度和行为多样性，提升自动驾驶轨迹预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集在长尾分布方面存在明显问题，而高密度场景和安全关键操作（如变道、超车和转弯）的缺乏阻碍了模型的泛化能力，导致过于乐观的评估。

Method: 我们提出了一种新颖的轨迹生成框架，增强场景密度和丰富行为多样性。该方法将连续的道路环境转换为支持细粒度路径规划、显式冲突检测和多代理协调的结构化网格表示。通过这一表示，我们引入了结合基于规则的决策触发、Frenet-based轨迹平滑和动态可行性约束的行为感知生成机制。

Result: 我们的方法显著提高了代理密度和行为多样性，同时保持了运动的现实性和场景级别的安全性。

Conclusion: 我们的合成数据还促进了下游轨迹预测模型，并在具有挑战性的高密度场景中提高了性能。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

Motivation: 为了避免开放环控制器中固定刺激强度导致的过度刺激和不足刺激的问题，提出了一种基于实时脚趾离地高度动态调整刺激强度的闭环FES控制器。

Method: 研究通过诱导脚下垂并比较闭环控制器和传统开放环控制器在不同步态条件下的效果，评估新系统。

Result: 闭环控制器在使用显著较低的刺激强度下，保持了足够的脚趾离地高度，同时对髋关节、膝关节和踝关节的角度未产生显著影响。

Conclusion: 所提议的方法不仅与现有系统的有效性相当，还具有减少肌肉疲劳和提高长期用户舒适度与依从性的潜力。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth
data. The flexible links are modeled as a series of rigid segments, with joint
angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and
0.00024~rad for $y$, $z$, and $\theta$, respectively.

Conclusion: 该控制器在速度和精度方面表现出显著改进。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有类人政策学习中，获取大量多样化的数据集非常困难且成本高昂。

Method: 通过人类运动转移技术，将人类动作转换为全身类人机器人的运动数据。

Result: 在三个复杂的实际任务中测试，HumanoidExo使类人政策能够在新环境中泛化，利用仅仅五个真实示范学习复杂的全身控制，并从HumanoidExo数据中获取新技能（如行走）。

Conclusion: HumanoidExo显著提升了类人机器人在动态现实场景中的表现，能够从有限的示范中学习和泛化。

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

Conclusion: 共同设计被确立为发展下一代智能和适应性人形机器人的基石。

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Motivation: 传统上，复杂未知系统的稳定性证明需要对系统动态有明确了解，这使得稳定性验证变得艰巨，因此需要一种新的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态真实世界中的机器人系统安全性提供了一种鲁棒的验证方法，且无需精确的系统模型。

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

Conclusion: 我们的学生VLA模型在性能上超过了RL教师，展示了整合多种能力的协同效应，且在真实世界实验中证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

Conclusion: VLMFP框架能够自主生成PDDL问题和域文件，展现出强大的可推广性和有效性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:
