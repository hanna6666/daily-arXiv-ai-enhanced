Most current approaches\nfollow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting\nin poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We\npresent RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic\nmanipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world\ndynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task\nplanning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable\nreplanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought\nreasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action\ngeneration. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to\nbalance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of\nRoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce\nRoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including\ninfeasible-task recognition and failure recovery.

While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively\ntransferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the\nsignificant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address\nthis challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce\nTraj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D\ntrajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate\nrepresentation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this\ntrajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse\ntrajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and\nrobot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific\nactions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.\nExtensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action\nboosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\\pi_0$ baseline on short-\nand long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data\nscales in robot policy learning.

To address this issue, we propose a two-stage\noutlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,\ninertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor\ngraph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed\nto detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less\nsensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a\nmore stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second\nstage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints\nare used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,\nwhich enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.\nBy combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved\nrobustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite\nmeasuring quality.

In the course of studying trafficking\nsurvivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental\norganization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the\nsurvivors by making the technique more communal. Bringing sociality to the\nforefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as\nindividuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research.\nFirst, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit\nvalues in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of\nthe survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a ``new\nnormal''. Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding\nspecific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can\nsupport reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors\nhold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but\nimportant social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid\nreintegration."}

While incorporating historical context\nthrough attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches\nprocess all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal\nstructure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery\npatterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that\nemploys a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard\nattention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies\nto better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach\ncombines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where\nvisual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage\ntemporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that\nSTA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling\napproaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x\nimprovement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks."}

To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target\nFabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to\nan arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid\nImitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with\nexplicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a\nwrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the\ntarget. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise\ntarget state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent\nvertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust\nmanipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a\nnovel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then\nproposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.\nThe RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing\nzero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong\ngeneralization across fabrics and scales.

Industrial standards\nsupporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the\nproduction phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and\n(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products\nthemselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of\nend-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This\npaper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource\n(PPR) modeling paradigm.

Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of\nacquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative\nparadigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the\nperformance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we\nestablish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of\ndistributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior\none-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A\nGr\\\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement\npropagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic\nperformance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General\nPolicy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by\ncombining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a\nconvex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the\nplug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA\nmodels, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of\ntheir input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical\nvalidation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside\nreal-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves\nperformance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of\nalternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into\nthe mechanisms underlying the success of GPC.
