Global route optimization for ETS in static 2D continuous environments remains largely underexplored due to the intractability of objective evaluation, stemming from the continuous nature of the environment and the interplay of motion and visibility constraints. Prior work has addressed this through partial discretization, leading to discrete-sensing formulations tackled via utility-greedy heuristics. Others have taken an indirect approach by heuristically approximating the objective using minimum latency problems on fixed graphs, enabling global route optimization via efficient metaheuristics. This paper builds on and significantly extends the latter by introducing Milaps (Minimum latency problems), a model-based solution framework for ETS. Milaps integrates novel auxiliary objectives and adapts a recent anytime metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem, chosen for its strong performance under tight runtime constraints. Evaluations on a novel large-scale dataset demonstrate superior trade-offs between solution quality and runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The best-performing strategy rapidly generates a preliminary solution, assigns static weights to sensing configurations, and optimizes global costs metaheuristically. Additionally, a qualitative study highlights the framework's flexibility across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Milaps\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u60012D\u8fde\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5bfb\u627e\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9884\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Milaps\u6a21\u578b-based\u89e3\u51b3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5.

Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple \"scene\" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM.

Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u673a\u5236\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u513f\u7ae5\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u513f\u7ae5\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u52a9\u529b\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u673a\u5236\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e14\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, their potential for fine-grained emotion understanding remains systematically underexplored. While open-vocabulary multimodal emotion recognition (MER-OV) has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the limitations of closed emotion sets, no comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs in this context currently exists. To address this, our work presents the first large-scale benchmarking study of MER-OV on the OV-MERD dataset, evaluating 19 mainstream MLLMs, including general-purpose, modality-specialized, and reasoning-enhanced architectures. Through systematic analysis of model reasoning capacity, fusion strategies, contextual utilization, and prompt design, we provide key insights into the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs for MER-OV. Our evaluation reveals that a two-stage, trimodal (audio, video, and text) fusion approach achieves optimal performance in MER-OV, with video emerging as the most critical modality. We further identify a surprisingly narrow gap between open- and closed-source LLMs. These findings establish essential benchmarks and offer practical guidelines for advancing open-vocabulary and fine-grained affective computing, paving the way for more nuanced and interpretable emotion AI systems.

Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice.

Compared to previous design study process models, our new model emphasizes: distinguishing between different stakeholders and target users before initiating specific designs, distinguishing design stages according to analytic logic or cognitive habits, and classifying task types as inferential or descriptive, and further hypothesis-based or hypothesis-free based on whether they involve multiple subgroups. In addition, our model refines previous models according to the characteristics of medical problems and provides referable guidance for each step. These improvements make the visualization design targeted, generalizable, and operational, which can adapt to the complexity and diversity of medical problems. We apply this model to guide the design of a visual analysis method and reanalyze three medical visualization-related works.

While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability.

We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts.

This paper presents a systematic evidence synthesis and exploratory investigation of VOC-based affective computing using low-cost sensors. Study 1, a systematic scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, analyzed 16 studies from 610 records across breath, sweat, skin, and urine biosources. Evidence indicates that stress and affective states are reflected in VOC signatures (aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, sulfur compounds), though with considerable heterogeneity. Current research relies predominantly on laboratory-grade GC-MS or PTR-MS, while wearable sensors provide pattern-level outputs without compound-specific identification - a critical gap for practical systems. Study 2 (n=25) investigated whether low-cost TVOC sensors (BME688, ENS160) combined with physiological monitoring (HR, HRV, GSR) can detect laboratory-induced stress. Exploratory analysis revealed that high cardiovascular reactors exhibited elevated TVOC during arithmetic stress (d=1.38), though requiring replication in larger samples. Substantial interindividual variability emerged (CV>80%), with coupling patterns moderated by baseline emission levels and temporal lags of 30-80 seconds. Random Forest-based multimodal classification achieved 77.3% accuracy (5-fold CV). SHAP analysis indicated VOC sensors contributed 24.9% of model performance. Leave-one-subject-out validation yielded 65.3% accuracy, highlighting the need for individual calibration. This work provides three contributions: (1) comprehensive mapping of VOC biomarker evidence and technological gaps, (2) initial demonstration that low-cost sensors can capture stress-related VOC patterns in multimodal fusion, and (3) identification of key implementation challenges. Findings require replication in larger samples (n>=50).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u6709\u673a\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff08VOCs\uff09\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4e0e\u538b\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u9700\u6269\u5927\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u786e\u8ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u6709\u673a\u5316\u5408\u7269\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u60c5\u7eea\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u7814\u7a761\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u7269\u6e90\u4e2dVOCs\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u7814\u7a762\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u751f\u7406\u76d1\u6d4b\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u538b\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u6709\u673a\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff08VOCs\uff09\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ca\u751f\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VOCs\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u56db\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u521d\u4e2d\u751f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u751f\u5219\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u5b66\u751f\u5728AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u7d20\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u5802\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\uff09\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u521d\u4e2d\u751f\u548c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u751f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u521d\u4e2d\u751f\u548c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u751f\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u7d20\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u521d\u4e2d\u751f\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u751f\u5219\u76f8\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002"}}

Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)", "summary": "Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6293\u53d6\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u529b\u91cf\u8c03\u8282\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u660e\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e5f\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u8c03\u8282\u6293\u53d6\u529b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6293\u53d6\u529b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6293\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u529b\u91cf\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u672a\u4e8b\u5148\u4e86\u89e3\u7269\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u53d6\u529b\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries.

While the minimal design enables simplicity and reduced payload, it also introduces challenges such as underactuation and sensitivity to external disturbances, including manipulation of heavy loads and pushing tasks. To address these, we employ reinforcement learning, training a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in simulation to generate feedforward commands for quadrotor acceleration and body rates, along with joint angle targets.

One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability.

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparScene\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f17\u591a\u9053\u8def\u7528\u6237\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6SparScene\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8f66\u9053\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u8f66\u9053\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo Open Motion Dataset\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSparScene\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u57285\u6beb\u79d2\u5185\u4e3a\u8d85\u8fc7200\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u52305000\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c17000\u6761\u8f66\u9053\u3002", "conclusion": "SparScene\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8fbe5000\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c17000\u6761\u8f66\u9053\u3002"}}

We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds.

However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schr\u00f6dinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schr\u00f6dinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments.

Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback.

However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data.

Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%).

Panov"], "title": "LookPlanGraph: Embodied Instruction Following Method with VLM Graph Augmentation", "comment": null, "summary": "Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.
