TL;DR: 这项研究比较了增强现实（AR）导航系统和传统纸质地图在医院导航中的有效性，发现AR用户在执行任务时更快、错误更少，且焦虑和认知负荷更低，但纸质地图用户在空间记忆上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医院环境复杂且认知负荷高，患者和访客往往难以熟悉其布局，因此本研究旨在探索增强现实导航系统在提升用户导航体验方面的有效性。

Method: 通过一项包含32名参与者的混合方法实验，测量导航性能、认知负荷、情境焦虑、空间行为和用户满意度。

Result: AR用户完成导航任务的速度明显更快，错误率更低，且焦虑感和认知负荷较低，而纸质地图用户在草图回忆任务中表现出更强的空间记忆能力。

Conclusion: 增强现实（AR）导航系统在大医院中显示出相较于传统纸质地图的显著优势，尤其在导航效率和用户满意度方面。然而，纸质地图在空间记忆方面表现更佳，显示出实时效率与长期空间学习之间的权衡。

Abstract: Hospitals are among the most cognitively demanding indoor environments, especially for patients and visitors unfamiliar with their layout. This study investigates the effectiveness of an augmented reality (AR)-based handheld navigation system compared to traditional paper maps in a large hospital setting. Through a mixed-methods experiment with 32 participants, we measured navigation performance, cognitive workload (NASA-TLX), situational anxiety (STAI-State), spatial behavior, and user satisfaction. Results show that AR users completed navigation tasks significantly faster, made fewer errors, and reported lower anxiety and workload. However, paper map users demonstrated stronger spatial memory in sketch-based recall tasks, highlighting a trade-off between real-time efficiency and long-term spatial learning. We discuss implications for inclusive AR design, spatial cognition, and healthcare accessibility, offering actionable design strategies for adaptive indoor navigation tools.

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了混合现实如何改善音乐制作中的协作，提出了MR-DAW系统，旨在提升远程音乐家的互动体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代音乐制作的数字音频工作站（DAWs）往往限制了音乐家的工作流程，难以实现自然的乐器互动，尤其在远程协作中遇到网络延迟和异步文件共享的问题。

Method: 采用定性与推测设计技术，调查目前音乐家如何使用DAWs，并设想协作式混合现实（MR）DAWs的未来，开发并评估了一个设计探针系统，MR-DAW。

Result: 通过对20名音乐家的访谈和系统评估，我们分析了当前的实践，报告了用户对MR系统的体验，并探讨了MR在音乐协作中的未来。

Conclusion: MR为无障碍音乐互动提供了可能性，并展望了音乐元宇宙中远程协作DAWs的未来。

Abstract: Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are central to modern music production but often encumber the musician's workflow, tethering them to a desk and hindering natural interaction with their instrument. Furthermore, effective remote collaboration remains a significant challenge, with existing solutions hampered by network latency and asynchronous file sharing. This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR. Our results highlight the affordances of MR for unencumbered musical interaction and provide a speculative outlook on the future of remote collaborative DAWs in the Musical Metaverse.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了有限视野对音乐合作的影响，结果表明，HoloJam提供了更高的共存感和更快的手势识别，而Mini Musicians应用程序则在标准AR设置中改善了反应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨在音乐合作中，视觉线索的重要性及其在使用扩展现实技术时如何受到限制。

Method: 进行了一个参与者间研究，比较了两种AR设置：具有52°有限视野的Nreal AR眼镜与不受限制视野的HoloJam全息设置。

Result: HoloJam提供了更高的共存感、快速的手势识别及更大的愉悦感，而Mini Musicians则改善了反应时间。

Conclusion: 有限视野影响音乐合作，但通知系统可以改善反应时间，未来的XR音乐合作中应考虑这一点。

Abstract: During musical collaboration, visual cues are essential for communication between musicians. Extended Reality (XR) applications, often used with head-mounted displays like Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, can limit the field of view (FOV) of players. We conducted a study to investigate the effects of limited FOV on co-presence, gesture recognition, overall enjoyment, and reaction time.
  Initially, we observed experienced musicians collaborating informally with and without visual occlusion, noting that collaboration suffered with limited FOV. We then conducted a within-subjects study with 19 participants, comparing an unrestricted FOV holographic setup called HoloJam to Nreal AR glasses with a 52$^{\circ}$ limited FOV. In the AR setup, we tested two conditions: standard AR with a 52$^{\circ}$ FOV and a modified AR notification system called Mini Musicians.
  Results showed that HoloJam provided higher co-presence, quicker gesture recognition, and greater enjoyment. The Mini Musicians application reduced reaction time and maintained enjoyment compared to the standard AR setup. We conclude that limited FOV impacts musical collaboration, but notifications can improve reaction time and should be considered in future XR music collaborations.

*Nelly Elsayed*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个多层次的社会技术框架，以评估和管理AI驱动的语音转文本系统的社会技术风险，并为医疗机构提供实施路线图，强调了保障患者自主权和文档完整性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI驱动的语音转文本系统在临床环境中的快速采用，迫切需要理解其潜在的社会技术风险，以支持其安全合理地融入医疗实践。

Method: 本研究综合了技术性能研究、监管与伦理标准、临床工作流程分析和组织政策指导的跨学科证据，形成了评估和治理STT系统的框架。

Result: 本文提出了一种多层次的社会技术概念框架，用于评估和管理语音转文本（STT）系统在临床应用中的表现，并强调患者自主权、文档完整性和机构信任的保障。

Conclusion: 研究表明，STT系统在社会技术环境中紧密耦合，模型性能、临床监督、患者权利、工作流程设计和机构治理相互依赖，提供了负责任和公平采用STT系统的可操作指导。

Abstract: AI-driven speech-to-text (STT) documentation systems are increasingly adopted in clinical settings to reduce documentation burden and improve workflow efficiency. However, their rapid deployment has outpaced understanding of the associated socio-technical risks, including transparency, reliability, patient autonomy, workflow alignment, and organizational governance. A clearer analysis of these risks is needed to support safe and equitable integration into healthcare practice. This study synthesizes interdisciplinary evidence from technical performance research, regulatory and ethical standards, clinical workflow analyses, and organizational policy guidance. The synthesis was used to develop a multi-layered socio-technical conceptual framework for evaluating and governing STT systems. Findings show that STT systems operate within tightly coupled socio-technical environments in which model performance, clinician oversight, patient rights, workflow design, and institutional governance are interdependent. The study offers a structured socio-technical governance framework and an implementation roadmap that outlines readiness assessment, vendor evaluation, pilot deployment, clinician training, ongoing monitoring, and iterative improvement. The framework emphasizes safeguards that protect patient autonomy, documentation integrity, and institutional trust while enabling the efficient and beneficial use of STT technologies. This work provides actionable guidance for healthcare organizations seeking to adopt STT systems responsibly and equitably.

### [5] [User Perceptions of an LLM-Based Chatbot for Cognitive Reappraisal of Stress: Feasibility Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00570)
*Ananya Bhattacharjee,Jina Suh,Mohit Chandra,Javier Hernandez*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究探索了一种基于大语言模型的职场压力再评估干预，结果表明显著降低了感知压力，对压力心态有积极影响，发现了用户在使用过程中的设计紧张点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多数字心理健康工具未能有效支持用户对压力源的自然描述，本研究旨在探索更灵活的干预方法。

Method: 对100名员工进行基于GPT-4o的聊天机器人的结构化认知再评估会话的可行性研究，使用配对Wilcoxon秩和检验分析短期结果，并通过情感与压力轨迹分析评估用户反馈。

Result: 通过采用基于大语言模型的单次干预，本文研究了职场压力再评估的可行性，显示显著降低了感知压力强度和改善了压力心态。

Conclusion: 集成大语言模型到数字心理健康干预中具有前景，但仍面临设计限制与挑战。

Abstract: Cognitive reappraisal is a well-studied emotion regulation strategy that helps individuals reinterpret stressful situations to reduce their impact. Many digital mental health tools struggle to support this process because rigid scripts fail to accommodate how users naturally describe stressors. This study examined the feasibility of an LLM-based single-session intervention (SSI) for workplace stress reappraisal. We assessed short-term changes in stress-related outcomes and examined design tensions during use. We conducted a feasibility study with 100 employees at a large technology company who completed a structured cognitive reappraisal session delivered by a GPT-4o-based chatbot. Pre-post measures included perceived stress intensity, stress mindset, perceived demand, and perceived resources. These outcomes were analyzed using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with correction for multiple comparisons. We also examined sentiment and stress trajectories across conversation quartiles using two RoBERTa-based classifiers and an LLM-based stress rater. Open-ended responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results showed significant reductions in perceived stress intensity and significant improvements in stress mindset. Changes in perceived resources and perceived demand trended in expected directions but were not statistically significant. Automated analyses indicated consistent declines in negative sentiment and stress over the course of the interaction. Qualitative findings suggested that participants valued the structured prompts for organizing thoughts, gaining perspective, and feeling acknowledged. Participants also reported tensions around scriptedness, preferred interaction length, and reactions to AI-driven empathy. These findings highlight both the promise and the design constraints of integrating LLMs into DMH interventions for workplace settings.

### [6] [The AI Invisibility Effect: Understanding Human-AI Interaction When Users Don't Recognize Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00579)
*Obada Kraishan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究分析了1484633条移动应用评论，发现尽管47.4%的应用具备AI功能，但只有11.9%的评论提及AI。AI应用的评分低于传统应用，且用户主要关注隐私问题，认为效率是主要好处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI快速集成到移动应用中，其对用户感知的影响亟需深入研究，以揭示用户对AI特性的态度和反馈。

Method: 通过情感分类、主题建模和关切-利益分类，分析来自iOS App Store和Google Play Store的1484633条评论，比较AI特征和控制应用。

Result: 发现AI应用的用户评分显著低于传统应用，但通过控制对AI的提及和评论特征后，这种负相关关系有所逆转，隐私问题占据主要用户关切。

Conclusion: 用户对AI特性的负面评价主要源于对其概念的不满，而不是AI的实际性能。本研究表明，用户更多关注隐私而非AI带来的好处，表明技术接受度的基本假设需重新考虑。

Abstract: The fast integration of artificial intelligence into mobile applications has completely changed the digital landscape; however, the impact of this change on user perception of AI features remains poorly understood. This large-scale analysis examined 1,484,633 mobile application reviews across 422 applications (200 AI-featuring, 222 control) from iOS App Store and Google Play Store. By employing sentiment classification, topic modeling, and concern-benefit categorization, we identified a major disconnect: only 11.9% of reviews mentioned AI, even though 47.4% of applications featured AI capabilities. AI-featuring applications received significantly lower ratings than traditional applications (d = 0.40); however, hierarchical regression revealed a hidden pattern - the negative relationship reversed after controlling for AI mentions and review characteristics (b = 0.405, p < .001). Privacy dominated user concerns (34.8% of concern-expressing reviews), while efficiency represented the primary benefit (42.3%). Effects varied greatly by category, from positive for Assistant applications (d = 0.55) to negative for Entertainment (d = -0.23). These findings suggest that AI features often operate below user awareness thresholds, and it is the explicit recognition of AI, rather than its mere presence, that drives negative evaluations. This challenges basic assumptions about technology acceptance in AI systems.

*Sanjida Islam Era,Ishika Tarin Ime,A. B. M. Alim Al Islam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究评估孟加拉国官方网站无障碍性，发现严重障碍，并呼吁定期审计与政策干预以提高在线服务的可及性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保数字无障碍性是实现在线服务的包容性访问的关键，但许多关键服务网站仍存在无障碍性及可用性障碍。

Method: 自动化无障碍评估与用户反馈相结合

Result: 分析212个网站，发现政府和非政府网站在无障碍性方面存在显著差异

Conclusion: 政府与非政府网站在可用性和功能表现上差异明显，但无障碍支持不一致，需定期审计和政策干预以提升数字包容性

Abstract: Ensuring digital accessibility is essential for inclusive access to online services. However, many government and non-government websites that provide critical services - such as education, healthcare, and public administration - continue to exhibit significant accessibility and usability barriers. This study evaluates the accessibility of Bangladeshi government and non-government websites under WCAG~2.2 by combining automated accessibility assessments with user-reported feedback. A total of 212 websites were analyzed using multiple automated tools, complemented by a survey of 103 users to capture real-world usability, accessibility, and security experiences. The results reveal substantial disparities between government and non-government websites, highlighting persistent issues related to navigation complexity, interaction cost, visual readability, accessibility feature adoption, and authentication mechanisms. While non-government websites generally demonstrate better usability and functional performance, accessibility support remains inconsistent across both categories. The findings underscore the need for regular accessibility audits, user-centered design practices, and policy-driven interventions to improve digital inclusivity and ensure equitable access to online services for diverse user populations.

### [8] [Wave2Word: A Multimodal Transformer Framework for Joint EEG-Text Alignment and Multi-Task Representation Learning in Neurocritical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00670)
*Argha Kamal Samanta,Deepak Mewada,Monalisa Sarma,Debasis Samanta*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出一种新的多模态EEG表示学习框架，通过综合信号域建模和临床语言监督，提高了EEG活动的检测和表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG建模方法存在学习表示与临床解释间的弱对应性，影响对有害脑活动的监测和理解。

Method: 多模态EEG表示学习框架，结合信号域建模和结构化临床语言监督

Result: 在六类测试中，取得了0.9797的准确率；消融分析表明，去除对比对齐大幅降低了跨模态检索性能。

Conclusion: 判别准确度并不能可靠地反映临床上有意义的EEG建模的表示质量。

Abstract: Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is routinely used in neurocritical care to monitor seizures and other harmful brain activity, including rhythmic and periodic patterns that are clinically significant. Although deep learning methods have achieved high accuracy in seizure detection, most existing approaches remain seizure-centric, rely on discrete-label supervision, and are primarily evaluated using accuracy-based metrics. A central limitation of current EEG modeling practice is the weak correspondence between learned representations and how EEG findings are interpreted and summarized in clinical workflows. Harmful EEG activity exhibits overlapping patterns, graded expert agreement, and temporal persistence, which are not well captured by classification objectives alone. This work proposes a multimodal EEG representation learning framework that integrates signal-domain modeling with structured clinical language supervision. First, raw EEG is transformed into a longitudinal bipolar montage and time-frequency representations. Second, dual transformer-based encoders model complementary temporal and frequency-centric dependencies and are fused using an adaptive gating mechanism. Third, EEG embeddings are aligned with structured expert consensus descriptions through a contrastive objective. Finally, an EEG-conditioned text reconstruction loss is introduced as a representation-level constraint alongside standard classification loss. Experimental evaluation using a controlled train-validation-test split achieves a six-class test accuracy of 0.9797. Ablation analyses show that removing contrastive alignment reduces cross-modal retrieval performance from Recall@10 of 0.3390 to 0.0045, despite minimal change in classification accuracy. These findings demonstrate that discriminative accuracy does not reliably reflect representation quality for clinically meaningful EEG modeling.

### [9] [The Effect of Transparency on Students' Perceptions of AI Graders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00765)
*Joslyn Orgill,Andra Rice,Max Fowler,Seth Poulsen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究考察了透明度对学生对自动评分系统的态度影响，发现透明度提高了学生的信任感，但对态度的总体影响不显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对自动评分系统的需求增加，理解学生对这些系统的态度变得至关重要，以便优化其设计和实施。

Method: 通过实验设计，对比有透明度和没有透明度的自动评分系统对学生态度的影响，进行调查与数据分析。

Result: 本研究探讨了透明度如何影响学生对自动评分系统（autograder）的态度。研究发现，提高透明度能够提升学生对自动评分精度的看法，并增加他们在调查评论中讨论自动评分器的意愿，但未能改善他们对通过自动评分器进行测验评分的愿意程度。

Conclusion: 尽管透明度增强了学生对自动评分器的信任感，但其对学生态度的影响有限，可能与本研究中学生对自动评分器的信任感较高有关。

Abstract: The development of effective autograders is key for scaling assessment and feedback. While NLP based autograding systems for open-ended response questions have been found to be beneficial for providing immediate feedback, autograders are not always liked, understood, or trusted by students. Our research tested the effect of transparency on students' attitudes towards autograders. Transparent autograders increased students' perceptions of autograder accuracy and willingness to discuss autograders in survey comments, but did not improve other related attitudes -- such as willingness to be graded by them on a test -- relative to the control without transparency. However, this lack of impact may be due to higher measured student trust towards autograders in this study than in prior work in the field. We briefly discuss possible reasons for this trend.

### [10] [Reinforcement learning with timed constraints for robotics motion planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00087)
*Zhaoan Wang,Junchao Li,Mahdi Mohammad,Shaoping Xiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的基于自动机的强化学习框架，能够在满足MITL规范的情况下为MDP和POMDP合成策略，具有较好的时间约束与性能目标平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态和不确定的环境中，机器人系统需要满足复杂任务序列和严格的时间约束，现有方法面临难题。

Method: 将MITL公式转化为Timed-LDGBA，并与决策过程同步，构建适用于Q学习的产品时间模型，同时设计简单的奖励结构以确保时间正确性。

Result: 在三项模拟研究中验证，包括5x5的MDP网格世界、10x10的POMDP网格世界和仿真服务机器人场景。结果表明该框架能够在随机转移、较大状态空间和部分可观测环境下有效学习策略。

Conclusion: 该框架具有在时间关键和不确定环境中可靠进行机器人规划的潜力。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments increasingly require planners that satisfy complex task sequences while adhering to strict temporal constraints. Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized Büchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings.

### [11] [Compositional Diffusion with Guided search for Long-Horizon Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00126)
*Utkarsh A Mishra,David He,Yongxin Chen,Danfei Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成模型组合方法CDGS，解决了多模态分布中的模式平均问题，实现了在多任务中的优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的组合生成模型在处理多模态分布时面临挑战，无法生成局部可行且全局一致的计划。

Method: Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS)

Result: CDGS addresses mode averaging by embedding search within the diffusion denoising process, exploring diverse combinations of local modes, filtering infeasible candidates, and ensuring global consistency through iterative resampling.

Conclusion: CDGS matches oracle performance on robot manipulation tasks and generalizes effectively across various domains, leading to coherent outputs in text-guided scenarios.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as powerful tools for planning, with compositional approaches offering particular promise for modeling long-horizon task distributions by composing together local, modular generative models. This compositional paradigm spans diverse domains, from multi-step manipulation planning to panoramic image synthesis to long video generation. However, compositional generative models face a critical challenge: when local distributions are multimodal, existing composition methods average incompatible modes, producing plans that are neither locally feasible nor globally coherent. We propose Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS), which addresses this \emph{mode averaging} problem by embedding search directly within the diffusion denoising process. Our method explores diverse combinations of local modes through population-based sampling, prunes infeasible candidates using likelihood-based filtering, and enforces global consistency through iterative resampling between overlapping segments. CDGS matches oracle performance on seven robot manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines that lack compositionality or require long-horizon training data. The approach generalizes across domains, enabling coherent text-guided panoramic images and long videos through effective local-to-global message passing. More details: https://cdgsearch.github.io/

*Junfeng Chen,Yuxiao Zhu,Xintong Zhang,Bing Luo,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究针对未知环境中的机器人探索和检查问题，提出了SLEI3D框架，集成了协作3D探索、适应性检查和实时通信的在线策略，并通过高保真模拟和硬件实验进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多应用中，环境中的兴趣区域未知，需要在探索过程中实时识别，现有的机器人组队技术主要针对已知静态环境，不适用于此类场景。

Method: 本研究提出了一个名为SLEI3D的框架，通过集成多层次和多速率的规划机制，支持机器人间的实时协调和通信，适应环境不确定性。

Result: 在高保真模拟中，SLEI3D框架成功应用于多个大型任务，参与机器人数量多达48台，验证了其在未知环境中协作执行任务的能力，另外还进行了7台机器人的硬件实验。

Conclusion: 提出的SLEI3D框架在多个大规模任务中得到了广泛验证，显示出其有效性和可行性。

Abstract: Robotic fleets such as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have been widely used for routine inspections of static environments, where the areas of interest are known and planned in advance. However, in many applications, such areas of interest are unknown and should be identified online during exploration. Thus, this paper considers the problem of simultaneous exploration, inspection of unknown environments and then real-time communication to a mobile ground control station to report the findings. The heterogeneous robots are equipped with different sensors, e.g., long-range lidars for fast exploration and close-range cameras for detailed inspection. Furthermore, global communication is often unavailable in such environments, where the robots can only communicate with each other via ad-hoc wireless networks when they are in close proximity and free of obstruction. This work proposes a novel planning and coordination framework (SLEI3D) that integrates the online strategies for collaborative 3D exploration, adaptive inspection and timely communication (via the intermit-tent or proactive protocols). To account for uncertainties w.r.t. the number and location of features, a multi-layer and multi-rate planning mechanism is developed for inter-and-intra robot subgroups, to actively meet and coordinate their local plans. The proposed framework is validated extensively via high-fidelity simulations of numerous large-scale missions with up to 48 robots and 384 thousand cubic meters. Hardware experiments of 7 robots are also conducted. Project website is available at https://junfengchen-robotics.github.io/SLEI3D/.

Abstract: Perching allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to reduce energy consumption, remain anchored for surface sampling operations, or stably survey their surroundings. Previous efforts for perching on vertical surfaces have predominantly focused on lightweight mechanical design solutions with relatively scant system-level integration. Furthermore, perching strategies for vertical surfaces commonly require high-speed, aggressive landing operations that are dangerous for a surveyor drone with sensitive electronics onboard. This work presents the preliminary investigation of a perching approach suitable for larger drones that both gently perches on vertical tree trunks and reacts and recovers from perch failures. The system in this work, called SLAP, consists of vision-based perch site detector, an IMU (inertial-measurement-unit)-based perch failure detector, an attitude controller for soft perching, an optical close-range detection system, and a fast active elastic gripper with microspines made from commercially-available slapbands. We validated this approach on a modified 1.2 kg commercial quadrotor with component and system analysis. Initial human-in-the-loop autonomous indoor flight experiments achieved a 75% perch success rate on a real oak tree segment across 20 flights, and 100% perch failure recovery across 2 flights with induced failures.

Conclusion: 该研究为车辆喷漆路径的自动化设计提供了一种有效方法，能够提高效率并保证喷漆质量。

Abstract: In vehicle production factories, the vehicle painting process employs multiple robotic arms to simultaneously apply paint to car bodies advancing along a conveyor line. Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and wheeled robots are widely used in many applications in both indoor and outdoor settings. In practical situations with limited GNSS signals or degraded lighting conditions, the navigation solution may rely only on inertial sensors and as result drift in time due to errors in the inertial measurement. In this work, we propose WiCHINS, a wheeled and chassis inertial navigation system by combining wheel-mounted-inertial sensors with a chassis-mounted inertial sensor for accurate pure inertial navigation. To that end, we derive a three-stage framework, each with a dedicated extended Kalman filter. This framework utilizes the benefits of each location (wheel/body) during the estimation process. To evaluate our proposed approach, we employed a dataset with five inertial measurement units with a total recording time of 228.6 minutes. We compare our approach with four other inertial baselines and demonstrate an average position error of 11.4m, which is $2.4\%$ of the average traveled distance, using two wheels and one body inertial measurement units. As a consequence, our proposed method enables robust navigation in challenging environments and helps bridge the pure-inertial performance gap.

Conclusion: 实验表明，该抓取系统能够以超过80%和95%的准确率分别成功抓取和投放ikura和意大利面。

Abstract: The food packaging industry goes through changes in food items and their weights quite rapidly. These items range from easy-to-pick, single-piece food items to flexible, long and cluttered ones. We propose a replaceable bit-based gripper system to tackle the challenge of weight-based handling of cluttered food items. The gripper features specialized food attachments(bits) that enhance its grasping capabilities, and a belt replacement system allows switching between different food items during packaging operations. It offers a wide range of control options, enabling it to grasp and drop specific weights of granular, cluttered, and entangled foods. We specifically designed bits for two flexible food items that differ in shape: ikura(salmon roe) and spaghetti. They represent the challenging categories of sticky, granular food and long, sticky, cluttered food, respectively. The gripper successfully picked up both spaghetti and ikura and demonstrated weight-specific dropping of these items with an accuracy over 80% and 95% respectively. The gripper system also exhibited quick switching between different bits, leading to the handling of a large range of food items.

Abstract: Space debris is an ever-increasing problem in space travel. There are already many old, no longer functional spacecraft and debris orbiting the earth, which endanger both the safe operation of satellites and space travel. Small nano-satellite swarms can address this problem by autonomously de-orbiting debris safely into the Earth's atmosphere. This work builds on the recent advances of autonomous agents deployed in resource-constrained platforms and shows a first simplified approach how such intelligent and autonomous nano-satellite swarms can be realized. We implement our autonomous agent software on wireless microcontrollers and perform experiments on a specialized test-bed to show the feasibility and overall energy efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: Many hybrid problems in robotics involve both continuous and discrete components, and modeling them together for estimation tasks has been a long standing and difficult problem. Hybrid Factor Graphs give us a mathematical framework to model these types of problems, however existing approaches for solving them are based on approximations. In this work, we propose an efficient Hybrid Factor Graph framework alongwith a variable elimination algorithm to produce a hybrid Bayes network, which can then be used for exact Maximum A Posteriori estimation and marginalization over both sets of variables. Our approach first develops a novel hybrid Gaussian factor which can connect to both discrete and continuous variables, and a hybrid conditional which can represent multiple continuous hypotheses conditioned on the discrete variables. Using these representations, we derive the process of hybrid variable elimination under the Conditional Linear Gaussian scheme, giving us exact posteriors as hybrid Bayes network. To bound the number of discrete hypotheses, we use a tree-structured representation of the factors coupled with a simple pruning and probabilistic assignment scheme, which allows for tractable inference. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a SLAM dataset with ambiguous measurements, where discrete choices for the most likely measurement have to be made. Our demonstrated results showcase the accuracy, generality, and simplicity of our hybrid factor graph framework.

Conclusion: 集成的系统能够从用户指令到多店导航和物体检索执行完整任务，同时通过文本地图和日志决策历史保持模块化和可调试性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end LLM-based agentic exploration system for an indoor shopping task, evaluated in both Gazebo simulation and a corresponding real-world corridor layout. The robot incrementally builds a lightweight semantic map by detecting signboards at junctions and storing direction-to-POI relations together with estimated junction poses, while AprilTags provide repeatable anchors for approach and alignment. Given a natural-language shopping request, an LLM produces a constrained discrete action at each junction (direction and whether to enter a store), and a ROS finite-state main controller executes the decision by gating modular motion primitives, including local-costmap-based obstacle avoidance, AprilTag approaching, store entry, and grasping. Qualitative results show that the integrated stack can perform end-to-end task execution from user instruction to multi-store navigation and object retrieval, while remaining modular and debuggable through its text-based map and logged decision history.

Conclusion: 新方法有效地处理了具有不同重要性的区域覆盖需求，实现了更快的响应速度和效率。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are widely used for coverage tasks that require efficient coordination across large environments. In Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), the objective is typically to minimize the makespan by generating non-overlapping paths for full-area coverage. However, most existing methods assume uniform importance across regions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where some zones require faster attention. We introduce the Priority-Aware MCPP (PA-MCPP) problem, where a subset of the environment is designated as prioritized zones with associated weights. The goal is to minimize, in lexicographic order, the total priority-weighted latency of zone coverage and the overall makespan. To address this, we propose a scalable two-phase framework combining (1) greedy zone assignment with local search, spanning-tree-based path planning, and (2) Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to standard MCPP baselines, while maintaining competitive makespan. Sensitivity analyses further show that the method scales well with the number of robots and that zone coverage behavior can be effectively controlled by adjusting priority weights.

Abstract: A large-scale mobile robot (LSMR) is a high-order multibody system that often operates on loose, unconsolidated terrain, which reduces traction. This paper presents a comprehensive navigation and control framework for an LSMR that ensures stability and safety-defined performance, delivering robust operation on slip-prone terrain by jointly leveraging high-performance techniques. The proposed architecture comprises four main modules: (1) a visual pose-estimation module that fuses onboard sensors and stereo cameras to provide an accurate, low-latency robot pose, (2) a high-level nonlinear model predictive control that updates the wheel motion commands to correct robot drift from the robot reference pose on slip-prone terrain, (3) a low-level deep neural network control policy that approximates the complex behavior of the wheel-driven actuation mechanism in LSMRs, augmented with robust adaptive control to handle out-of-distribution disturbances, ensuring that the wheels accurately track the updated commands issued by high-level control module, and (4) a logarithmic safety module to monitor the entire robot stack and guarantees safe operation. The proposed low-level control framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation subsystem, while the safety module ensures the whole system-level safety during operation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in many robotic applications, but it requires extensive exploration of the state-action space, during which behaviors can be unsafe. This significantly limits its applicability to large robots with complex actuators operating on unstable terrain. Hence, to design a safe goal-reaching control framework for large-scale robots, this paper decomposes the whole system into a set of tightly coupled functional modules. 1) A real-time visual pose estimation approach is employed to provide accurate robot states to 2) an RL motion planner for goal-reaching tasks that explicitly respects robot specifications. The RL module generates real-time smooth motion commands for the actuator system, independent of its underlying dynamic complexity. 3) In the actuation mechanism, a supervised deep learning model is trained to capture the complex dynamics of the robot and provide this model to 4) a model-based robust adaptive controller that guarantees the wheels track the RL motion commands even on slip-prone terrain. 5) Finally, to reduce human intervention, a mathematical safety supervisor monitors the robot, stops it on unsafe faults, and autonomously guides it back to a safe inspection area. The proposed framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation system and safety of the whole operation. Experiments on a 6,000 kg robot in different scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，儿童对机器人错误的反应具有灵活性，设计人机交互系统时需考虑儿童的特点。

Abstract: How do children respond to repeated robot errors? While prior research has examined adult reactions to successive robot errors, children's responses remain largely unexplored. In this study, we explore children's reactions to robot social errors and performance errors. For the latter, this study reproduces the successive robot failure paradigm of Liu et al. with child participants (N=59, ages 8-10) to examine how young users respond to repeated robot conversational errors. Participants interacted with a robot that failed to understand their prompts three times in succession, with their behavioral responses video-recorded and analyzed. We found both similarities and differences compared to adult responses from the original study. Like adults, children adjusted their prompts, modified their verbal tone, and exhibited increasingly emotional non-verbal responses throughout successive errors. However, children demonstrated more disengagement behaviors, including temporarily ignoring the robot or actively seeking an adult. Errors did not affect participants' perception of the robot, suggesting more flexible conversational expectations in children. These findings inform the design of more effective and developmentally appropriate human-robot interaction systems for young users.

Abstract: A well-designed reward is critical for effective reinforcement learning-based policy improvement. In real-world robotic domains, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) \textbf{RoboReward}, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a \emph{negative examples data augmentation} pipeline that generates calibrated \emph{negatives} and \emph{near-misses} via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we produce an extensive training and evaluation dataset that spans diverse tasks and embodiments and enables systematic evaluation of whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robotics. Our evaluation of leading open-weight and proprietary VLMs reveals that no model excels across all tasks, underscoring substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B-parameter reward VLM in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a frontier physical reasoning VLM trained on robotics data, by a large margin, while substantially narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards.

Conclusion: 系统通过可观测性分析，验证了IMU锚定的重要性，并通过消融研究展示了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deformable scenes violate the rigidity assumptions underpinning classical visual-inertial odometry (VIO), often leading to over-fitting to local non-rigid motion or severe drift when deformation dominates visual parallax. We introduce DefVINS, a visual-inertial odometry framework that explicitly separates a rigid, IMU-anchored state from a non--rigid warp represented by an embedded deformation graph. The system is initialized using a standard VIO procedure that fixes gravity, velocity, and IMU biases, after which non-rigid degrees of freedom are activated progressively as the estimation becomes well conditioned. An observability analysis is included to characterize how inertial measurements constrain the rigid motion and render otherwise unobservable modes identifiable in the presence of deformation. This analysis motivates the use of IMU anchoring and informs a conditioning-based activation strategy that prevents ill-posed updates under poor excitation. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of combining inertial constraints with observability-aware deformation activation, resulting in improved robustness under non-rigid environments.
