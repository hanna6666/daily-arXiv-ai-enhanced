Using interview data from \\rev{41} participants, we identify their intersectional experiences as mediated by TikTok's socio-technical affordances. We argue that BlindTokers' intersectional marginalization is infrastructural: TikTok's classification and moderation features interact with social norms in ways that push them aside and distort how they are treated on the platform. We use this infrastructure perspective to understand what these experiences are, how they were formed, and how they become harmful.

Each device packages a miniature surface-mount LED in a gas-filled cavity that contains a low-inertia graphite photoabsorber. The cavity is sealed by an elastic membrane, which functions as a working diaphragm. Brief optical pulses heat the photoabsorber, which heats the gas. The resulting rapid pressure increases generate forces and displacements at the working diaphragm. Millimeter-scale HLEDs produce forces exceeding 0.4 N and displacements of 1 mm at low voltages, with 5 to 100 ms response times, making them attractive as actuators providing tactile feedback in human-machine interfaces. Perceptual testing revealed that the strength of tactile feedback increased linearly with optical power. HLEDs devices are mechanically simple and efficient to fabricate.

In a pre-registered study (N = 1,648), participants completed six classic decision-making tasks via a chatbot with dialogues of varying complexity. Participants exhibited two well-documented cognitive biases: the Framing Effect and the Status Quo Bias. Increased dialogue complexity resulted in participants reporting higher mental demand. This increase in cognitive load selectively, but significantly, increased the effect of the biases, demonstrating the load-bias interaction. We then evaluated whether LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models) could predict individual decisions given demographic information and prior dialogue. While results were mixed across choice problems, LLM predictions that incorporated dialogue context were significantly more accurate in several key scenarios. Importantly, their predictions reproduced the same bias patterns and load-bias interactions observed in humans. Across all models tested, the GPT-4 family consistently aligned with human behavior, outperforming GPT-5 and open-source models in both predictive accuracy and fidelity to human-like bias patterns. These findings advance our understanding of LLMs as tools for simulating human decision-making and inform the design of conversational agents that adapt to user biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u89c1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u516d\u9879\u7ecf\u5178\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u73b0\u72b6\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e00\u81f4\u91cd\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8d1f\u8377-\u504f\u89c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Our system integrates a speech-capable large language model with an interactive spherical display. It enables children to ask natural-language questions and receive coordinated verbal explanations and visual responses through the LLM-augmented visualization updating in real time based on spoken queries.

In the last six years, ROS~2 has drawn increasing attention from the real-time systems community and industry. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of research efforts that analyze, enhance, and extend ROS~2 to support real-time execution. We first provide a detailed description of the internal scheduling mechanisms of ROS~2 and its layered architecture, including the interaction with DDS-based communication and other communication middleware. We then review key contributions from the literature, covering timing analysis for both single- and multi-threaded executors, metrics such as response time, reaction time, and data age, and different communication modes. The survey also discusses community-driven enhancements to the ROS~2 runtime, including new executor algorithm designs, real-time GPU management, and microcontroller support via micro-ROS.

In this work, we present a hierarchical control framework that integrates predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots. Our approach employs a novel power prediction network that forecasts energy consumption across different gait patterns over a 1-second horizon, enabling intelligent selection of the most energy-efficient nominal gait. A reinforcement learning policy then generates residual adjustments to this nominal gait, fine-tuning the robot's actions to balance energy efficiency with performance objectives. Comparative analysis shows our method reduces energy consumption by up to 35\\% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

Related to an earlier IEEE ICAR 2021 publication", "summary": "Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.\n  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f16\u961f\u4e2d\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u95f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u7531\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u671b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7531\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6267\u884c\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f16\u961f\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f66\u961f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u3002"}}

However, discovering the salient graph patterns that form this structure is notoriously difficult for two reasons. (1) Finding important patterns, such as cliques and bicliques, is computationally hard. (2) Real-world graphs contain noise, and therefore do not always exhibit patterns in their pure form. Defining meaningful noisy patterns and detecting them efficiently is a currently unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose to use well-ordered matrices as a tool to both define and effectively detect noisy patterns. Specifically, we represent a graph as its adjacency matrix and optimally order it using Moran's $I$. Standard graph patterns (cliques, bicliques, and stars) now translate to rectangular submatrices. Using Moran's $I$, we define a permitted level of noise for such patterns. A combination of exact algorithms and heuristics allows us to efficiently decompose the matrix into noisy patterns. We also introduce a novel motif simplification that visualizes noisy patterns while explicitly encoding the level of noise. We showcase our techniques on several real-world data sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u5e8f\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528Moran's I\u4f18\u5316\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u8981\u56fe\u6848\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u5e8f\u77e9\u9635\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Moran's I\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u7684\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline. Results show that participants successfully used the system to modify trajectories in real time. Moreover, the bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency, demonstrating that the robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience.

Rather than replacing the cognitive work of users, GenAI systems should be designed to support and scaffold it. Therefore, this paper introduces an LLM-based conversational copilot designed to scaffold information evaluation rather than provide answers and foster digital literacy skills. In a pre-registered, randomised controlled trial (N=261) examining three interface conditions including a chat-based copilot, our mixed-methods analysis reveals that users engaged deeply with the copilot, demonstrating metacognitive reflection.

Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \\algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6c34\u4e0b\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6620\u5c04\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u56fe\u50cf\u9000\u5316\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u6c34\u4e0b\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884csim-to-real\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u3001\u6c14\u538b\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1(DVL)\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6c34\u4e0bSLAM\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u6c34\u4e0b\u7acb\u4f53\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6c89\u8239\u73b0\u573a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u4e0b\u7acb\u4f53\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6c89\u8239\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%.

Conventional methods often rely on complex force sensing hardware that introduces control latency. This paper presents a minimalist framework utilizing a single, low cost Inertial-Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the crutch hand grip, eliminating the need for mechanical modifications. We propose a five phase classification system, including standard gait phases and a non locomotor auxiliary state, to prevent undesired motion. Three deep learning architectures were benchmarked on both a PC and an embedded system. To improve performance under data constrained conditions, models were augmented with a Finite State Machine (FSM) to enforce biomechanical consistency. The Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) emerged as the superior architecture, yielding the highest success rates and lowest latency.

Compared to other fields of engineering where dual-use risks are present - e.g., those that underlie the development of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and even the field of AI, robotics offers no specific regulation and little guidance as to how research and innovation may be conducted and disseminated responsibly. While other fields can be used for guidance, robotics has its own needs and specificities which have to be taken into account. The robotics community should therefore work toward its own set of sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation.

End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60-\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u63a8\u5e7f\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u653f\u7b56\u9884\u6d4b\u63a5\u89e6\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42RL-MPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6cdb\u5316\u63a8\u9001\u548c\u7269\u4f533D\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fd1\u4e4e100%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6-shot\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a framework for conceptualizing sociotechnical challenges of machine learning grounded in qualitative fieldwork, a review of longitudinal deployment studies, and co-design workshops with healthcare and social welfare practitioners. The framework comprises (1) a categorization of eleven sociotechnical challenges organized along an ML-enabled care pathway, and (2) a process-oriented account of the conditions through which these challenges emerge across design and use.

Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission. This approach has the potential to significantly improve safety on construction sites by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9644\u52a0\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u9690\u853d\u7740\u9646\u533a\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u5728\u964d\u843d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u963b\u788d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u89c6\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u53e3\u5934\u6216\u624b\u52bf\u6307\u4ee4\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u9644\u676f\u5b89\u88c5\u5230\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u5904\u7406\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u65b9\u5730\u9762\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65bd\u5de5\u73b0\u573a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u77ac\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization.

To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation.

This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models.

Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer.

This paper presents a pragmatic approach that addresses these issues by adding a control filter on each autonomous vehicle that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts, including crewed vessels. This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators.

Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning.

This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents?

To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models.

A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MPNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53cc\u624b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u4efb\u52a1\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7269\u7406\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
