This study proposes an emotion-aware automation framework guided by the emotional Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (eBICA), which integrates appraisal, somatic responses, and behavior selection. We conducted a proof-of-concept experiment in a pseudo-smart-home environment, where participants were exposed to an anxiety-inducing event followed by a comfort-inducing automation. State anxiety (STAI-S) was measured throughout the task sequence. The results showed a significant reduction in STAI-S immediately after introducing the avoidance automation, demonstrating that emotion-based control can effectively promote psychological safety. Furthermore, an analysis of individual characteristics suggested that personality and anxiety-related traits modulate the degree of relief, indicating the potential for personalized emotion-adaptive automation. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that eBICA-based emotional control can function effectively in smart home environments and offers a foundation for next-generation affective home automation systems."}

Drawing on an eight-month ethnography of Bangladesh's platform labor industry and inspired by Gray and Suri, we conceptualize Ghostcrafting AI to describe how workers materially enable AI while remaining invisible or erased from recognition. Workers pursue platform labor as a path to prestige and mobility but sustain themselves through resourceful, situated learning - renting cyber-cafe computers, copying gig templates, following tutorials in unfamiliar languages, and relying on peer networks. At the same time, they face exploitative wages, unreliable payments, biased algorithms, and governance structures that make their labor precarious and invisible. To cope, they develop tactical repertoires such as identity masking, bypassing platform fees, and pirated tools. These practices reveal both AI's dependency on ghostcrafted labor and the urgent need for design, policy, and governance interventions that ensure fairness, recognition, and sustainability in platform futures."}

This study presents a Modified TSception architecture designed for the robust assessment of driver fatigue using Electroencephalography (EEG). The model introduces a novel hierarchical architecture that surpasses the original TSception by implementing a five-layer temporal refinement strategy to capture multi-scale brain dynamics. A key innovation is the use of Adaptive Average Pooling, which provides the structural flexibility to handle varying EEG input dimensions, and a two - stage fusion mechanism that optimizes the integration of spatiotemporal features for improved stability. When evaluated on the SEED-VIG dataset and compared against established methods - including SVM, Transformer, EEGNet, ConvNeXt, LMDA-Net, and the original TSception - the Modified TSception achieves a comparable accuracy of 83.46% (vs. 83.15% for the original). Critically, the proposed model exhibits a substantially reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), signifying a marked improvement in performance stability. Furthermore, the architecture's generalizability is validated on the STEW mental workload dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results with 95.93% and 95.35% accuracy for 2-class and 3-class classification, respectively. These improvements in consistency and cross-task generalizability underscore the effectiveness of the proposed modifications for reliable EEG-based monitoring of drowsiness and mental workload."}

However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments."}

PaceForecaster takes the robot's local sensor footprint (Level-1) and the provided co-pilot instructions as input and predicts (i) a forecasted map with all regions visible from Level-1 (Level-2) and (ii) an instruction-conditioned subgoal within Level-2. The subgoal provides the planner with explicit guidance to exploit the forecasted environment in a goal-directed manner. We integrate PaceForecaster with a Log-MPPI controller and demonstrate that using language-conditioned forecasts and goals improves navigation performance by 36% over a local-map-only baseline while in polygonal environments."}

In virtual reality (VR) environments, inducing the FBI has been shown to modulate users' bodily experiences and behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that embodying avatars with specific characteristics can influence users' actions, largely through the activation of implicit stereotypes. However, few studies have explicitly manipulated users' impressions of an avatar by introducing narrative context. The present study investigated how avatar narrativity, induced through contextual narratives, affects the FBI. Healthy participants embodied a powerful artificial lifeform avatar in VR after listening to either a positive narrative, in which the avatar used its abilities to protect others, or a negative narrative, in which it misused its power. Participants' impressions of the avatar and indices of bodily self-consciousness were subsequently assessed. The results showed that positive narratives significantly enhanced the sense of agency (SoA), and that SoA was positively correlated with participants' perceived personal familiarity with the avatar. These findings suggest that the avatar narrativity can modulate embodiment in VR."}

As drone density increases, UAM operations are expected to experience congestion similar to that in ground traffic. However, the fundamental characteristics of UAM traffic flow, particularly under real-world operating conditions, remain poorly understood. This study proposes a general framework for constructing the fundamental diagram (FD) of UAM traffic by integrating theoretical analysis with physical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to derive a UAM FD using real-world physical test data. On the theoretical side, we design two drone control laws for collision avoidance and develop simulation-based traffic generation methods to produce diverse UAM traffic scenarios. Based on Edie's definition, traffic flow theory is then applied to construct the FD and characterize the macroscopic properties of UAM traffic. To account for real-world disturbances and modeling uncertainties, we further conduct physical experiments on a reduced-scale testbed using Bitcraze Crazyflie drones. Both simulation and physical test trajectory data are collected and organized into the UAMTra2Flow dataset, which is analyzed using the proposed framework. Preliminary results indicate that classical FD structures for ground transportation are also applicable to UAM systems. Notably, FD curves obtained from physical experiments exhibit deviations from simulation-based results, highlighting the importance of experimental validation. Finally, results from the reduced-scale testbed are scaled to realistic operating conditions to provide practical insights for future UAM traffic systems.

In this paper, we propose SketchPlay, a novel VR interaction framework that transforms humans' air-drawn sketches and gestures into dynamic, physically realistic scenes, making content creation intuitive and playful like drawing. Specifically, sketches capture the structure and spatial arrangement of objects and scenes, while gestures convey physical cues such as velocity, direction, and force that define movement and behavior. By combining these complementary forms of input, SketchPlay captures both the structure and dynamics of user-created content, enabling the generation of a wide range of complex physical phenomena, such as rigid body motion, elastic deformation, and cloth dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional text-driven methods, SketchPlay offers significant advantages in expressiveness, and user experience. By providing an intuitive and engaging creation process, SketchPlay lowers the entry barrier for non-expert users and shows strong potential for applications in education, art, and immersive storytelling."}

In the language modeling domain, test-time compute scaling has revolutionized reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs by leveraging additional inference-time compute for candidate solution refinement. These methods typically leverage foundation models as verification modules in a zero-shot manner to synthesize improved candidate solutions. In this work, we hypothesize that generative policies can similarly benefit from additional inference-time compute that employs zero-shot VLM-based verifiers. A systematic analysis of improving policy performance through the generation-verification framework remains relatively underexplored in the current literature. To this end, we introduce EVE - a modular, generator-verifier interaction framework - that boosts the performance of pretrained generative policies at test time, with no additional training. EVE wraps a frozen base policy with multiple zero-shot, VLM-based verifier agents. Each verifier proposes action refinements to the base policy candidate actions, while an action incorporator fuses the aggregated verifier output into the base policy action prediction to produce the final executed action. We study design choices for generator-verifier information interfacing across a system of verifiers with distinct capabilities. Across a diverse suite of manipulation tasks, EVE consistently improves task success rates without any additional policy training. Through extensive ablations, we isolate the contribution of verifier capabilities and action incorporator strategies, offering practical guidelines to build scalable, modular generator-verifier systems for embodied control."}

However, a substantial amount of data from prior missions remain underutilized for path planning and autonomous navigation research. As a result, there is a lack of space mission-based planetary datasets, standardized benchmarks, and evaluation protocols. In this paper, we take a step towards coordinating these three research directions in the context of planetary rover path planning. We propose the first two large planar benchmark datasets, MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench, derived from high-resolution digital terrain images of Mars and the Moon. In addition, we set up classical and learned path planning algorithms, in a unified framework, and evaluate them on our proposed datasets and on a popular planning benchmark. Through comprehensive experiments, we report new insights on the performance of representative path planning algorithms on planetary terrains, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Our results show that classical algorithms can achieve up to 100% global path planning success rates on average across challenging terrains such as Moon's north and south poles. This suggests, for instance, why these algorithms are used in practice by NASA. Conversely, learning-based models, although showing promising results in less complex environments, still struggle to generalize to planetary domains.

The STT is formulated as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius evolve online based on uncertain sensory information. We derive a closed-form, approximation-free control law that confines the system trajectory within the tube, ensuring both probabilistic safety and task satisfaction. Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target.

The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines.

In this work, we propose MAction-SocialNav, an efficient vision language model for socially compliant navigation that explicitly addresses action ambiguity, enabling generating multiple plausible actions within one scenario. To enhance the model's reasoning capability, we introduce a novel meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) method. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method, we curate a multi-action socially compliant navigation dataset that accounts for diverse conditions, including crowd density, indoor and outdoor environments, and dual human annotations.

In this work, we propose a trajectory planning method based on nonlinear optimization for a close-range rendezvous to bring a free-floating, rotating debris object in a two-dimensional plane into the manipulator's workspace, as a preliminary step for its capture. The proposed method introduces a dynamic keep-out sphere that adapts depending on the approach conditions, allowing for closer and safer access to the target. Furthermore, a control strategy is developed to reproduce the optimized trajectory using discrete ON/OFF thrusters, considering practical implementation constraints."}

This work addresses the problem of estimating the inertia parameters of an unknown target object during manipulation. We apply and extend an existing online identification method by incorporating momentum conservation, enabling its use for the floating-base robots. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, and the estimated parameters are compared with ground-truth values. Results demonstrate accurate identification in the scenarios, highlighting the method's applicability to on-orbit servicing and other space missions."}

One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments."}

However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation settings, we illustrate how our method consistently outperforms strong modular and monolithic baselines."}

Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module that utilizes vision foundation models to extract and fuse two key features: 1) geometric features from subtle stereo-view differences for spatial perception; 2) semantic-rich features from the monocular view for instruction following. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary Interaction-Region Depth Estimation task to further enhance spatial perception and accelerate model convergence. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines by a large margin in diverse tasks under the stereo setting and demonstrates strong robustness to camera pose variations."}

Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management."}
