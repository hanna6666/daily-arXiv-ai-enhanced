Decoding Human Safety Perception with Eye-Tracking Systems, Street View Images, and Explainable AI", "comment": "28 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "The way residents perceive safety plays an important role in how they use\npublic spaces. Studies have combined large-scale street view images and\nadvanced computer vision techniques to measure the perception of safety of\nurban environments. Despite their success, such studies have often overlooked\nthe specific environmental visual factors that draw human attention and trigger\npeople's feelings of safety perceptions. In this study, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that enriches the existing body of literature on place\nperception by using eye-tracking systems with street view images and deep\nlearning approaches. Eye-tracking systems quantify not only what users are\nlooking at but also how long they engage with specific environmental elements.\nThis allows us to explore the nuance of which visual environmental factors\ninfluence human safety perceptions. We conducted our research in Helsingborg,\nSweden, where we recruited volunteers outfitted with eye-tracking systems. They\nwere asked to indicate which of the two street view images appeared safer. By\nexamining participants' focus on specific features using Mean Object Ratio in\nHighlighted Regions (MoRH) and Mean Object Hue (MoH), we identified key visual\nelements that attract human attention when perceiving safe environments. For\ninstance, certain urban infrastructure and public space features draw more\nhuman attention while the sky is less relevant in influencing safety\nperceptions.

Unlike standard diffusion-based planners\nthat use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of\ntask-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived\nfrom Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states\nor their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to\nproduce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to\nbiased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior\nexpressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from\ntrajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned\nstructured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the\nfull trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and\nKUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and\nstronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies\nindicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits\nbeyond simply conditioning the neural network.

This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory\ncoherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.\nCrucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation\npolicy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and\nobjects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,\ngeneral-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and\nvisual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen.

Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based\non tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We\ndesign a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple\nfingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train\nthis policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile\nmodel in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.\nComparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning\nwith a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over\nsimulation-only training.

To bridge this\ngap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified\nrepresentation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between\nperception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes\nlatent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and\nevolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product\n(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured\nstochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning\nbetween perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive\nloss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent\nperception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both\nlatent updates and action refinements.

Existing\nlocalization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as\nlandmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,\nghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in\nsingle-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address\nthese issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{S}upervised\n\\textbf{S}tate \\textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar\nsignal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial\ninformation to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the\nassociation between \\textit{exteroceptive} radar and \\textit{proprioceptive}\ninertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits.

Kuchenbecker"], "title": "ISyHand: A Dexterous Multi-finger Robot Hand with an Articulated Palm", "comment": "Accepted at IEEE Humanoids 2025", "summary": "The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized\nmanufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of\nmodern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have\ncome to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors\nand 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source\nhands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and\nattempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce\nthe open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,\neasy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses\noff-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be\nassembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.\nThe ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with\nonly a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism.

In these scenarios,\nconsistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult\ndue to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for\nmotion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to\novercome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as\nobstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential\nsolution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for\nthe planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a\nhistory of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world\nmodels, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to\nreroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major\niterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search\nfor every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world\nmodels. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,\ndefer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH\nuses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each\nworld. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic\nsolutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than\none-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of\nresults from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a\nClearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost\ntrajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH.

We further\nintroduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP\nproduces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.\nExperiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets\nachieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.", "AI": {"tldr": "LfH-CP \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u6216\u8bd5\u9519\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "LfH-CP \u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "LfH-CP \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the\nsignificant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically\nimplausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,\ncommon retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment\ninteractions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions\nfrom OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour\ntrajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact\npreservation than widely used baselines.

Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision\nand language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact\nwithin the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a\ncomprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which\nis crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we\nintroduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively\nperceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory\nobjectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance\nperceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment\nscheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a\nperception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,\n3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To\nfurther enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future\nmultisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about\nsemantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust\nconditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,\ncontact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved\ngeneralization to unseen configurations.
