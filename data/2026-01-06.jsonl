While augmenting pretrained models with test-time search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can mitigate these failures, existing formulations rely solely on the VLA prior for guidance, lacking a grounded estimate of expected future return. Consequently, when the prior is inaccurate, the planner can only correct action selection via the exploration term, which requires extensive simulation to become effective. To address this limitation, we introduce Value Vision-Language-Action Planning and Search (V-VLAPS), a framework that augments MCTS with a lightweight, learnable value function. By training a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the latent representations of a fixed VLA backbone (Octo), we provide the search with an explicit success signal that biases action selection toward high-value regions. We evaluate V-VLAPS on the LIBERO robotic manipulation suite, demonstrating that our value-guided search improves success rates by over 5 percentage points while reducing the average number of MCTS simulations by 5-15 percent compared to baselines that rely only on the VLA prior."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a design-grounded human-aware planning framework for human-robot collaborative structured assembly. The framework comprises two coupled modules. Module I, Perception-to-Symbolic State (PSS), employs vision-language models (VLMs) based agents to align RGB-D observations with design specifications and domain knowledge, synthesizing verifiable symbolic assembly states. It outputs validated installed and uninstalled component sets for online state tracking. Module II, Human-Aware Planning and Replanning (HPR), performs task-level multi-robot assignment and updates the plan only when the observed state deviates from the expected execution outcome. It applies a minimal-change replanning rule to selectively revise task assignments and preserve plan stability even under human interventions. We validate the framework on a 27-component timber-frame assembly. The PSS module achieves 97% state synthesis accuracy, and the HPR module maintains feasible task progression across diverse HRC scenarios. Results indicate that integrating VLM-based perception with knowledge-driven planning improves robustness of state estimation and task planning under dynamic conditions."}

Among the experimental robot-assisted technologies, the magnetic field gradients of the MRI scanner are used to power and maneuver ferromagnetic applicators for accessing sites in the patient's body via the vascular network. In this work, we propose a computational platform for preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators inside blood vessels. This platform was implemented as a two-way data and command pipeline that links the MRI scanner, the computational core, and the operator. The platform first processes multi-slice MR data to extract the vascular bed and then fits a virtual corridor inside the vessel. This corridor serves as a virtual fixture (VF), a forbidden region for the applicators to avoid vessel perforation or collision. The geometric features of the vessel centerline, the VF, and MRI safety compliance (dB/dt, max available gradient) are then used to generate magnetic field gradient waveforms. Different blood flow profiles can be user-selected, and those parameters are used for modeling the applicator's maneuvering. The modeling module further generates cues about whether the selected vascular path can be safely maneuvered. Given future experimental studies that require a real-time operation, the platform was implemented on the Qt framework (C/C++) with software modules performing specific tasks running on dedicated threads: PID controller, generation of VF, generation of MR gradient waveforms."}

The system relies solely on a monocular camera, ensuring fast map building and navigation using key nodes. Experiments show effective loop detection and navigation in real and simulation environments without pre-training. Compared to a ResNet-based method, this approach improves success rates by 60.2% on average while reducing time and space costs, offering a lightweight solution for robot and human navigation in various scenarios."}

Achieving this vision is highly challenging and requires much more than just language modeling. It involves numerous complex AI challenges, such as conversational AI, maintaining character integrity, managing personality and emotions, handling knowledge and memory, synthesizing voice, generating animations, enabling real-world interactions, and integration with physical environments. Recent advancements in the development of foundation models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks have enabled researchers to address these individual challenges. However, combining these technologies for interactive characters remains an open problem. We present a system and platform for conveniently designing believable digital characters, enabling a conversational and story-driven experience while providing solutions to all of the technical challenges. As a proof-of-concept, we introduce Digital Einstein, which allows users to engage in conversations with a digital representation of Albert Einstein about his life, research, and persona. While Digital Einstein exemplifies our methods for a specific character, our system is flexible and generalizes to any story-driven or conversational character. By unifying these diverse AI components into a single, easy-to-adapt platform, our work paves the way for immersive character experiences, turning the dream of lifelike, story-based interactions into a reality."}

Field experimentation in such environments is costly, high-risk, and constrained by limited vehicle availability, making early validation of autonomous behaviors difficult. This paper presents a simulation-based study of a complete autonomous subsea object recovery mission using a Hadal Small Vehicle (HSV) equipped with a three-degree-of-freedom robotic arm and a suction-actuated end effector. The Stonefish simulator is used to model realistic vehicle dynamics, hydrodynamic disturbances, sensing, and interaction with a target object under hadal-like conditions. The control framework combines a world-frame PID controller for vehicle navigation and stabilization with an inverse-kinematics-based manipulator controller augmented by acceleration feed-forward, enabling coordinated vehicle - manipulator operation. In simulation, the HSV autonomously descends from the sea surface to 6,000 m, performs structured seafloor coverage, detects a target object, and executes a suction-based recovery. The results demonstrate that high-fidelity simulation provides an effective and low-risk means of evaluating autonomous deep-sea intervention behaviors prior to field deployment."}

However, existing LLM-based search systems primarily rely on semantic features, creating a misalignment with the socialized cognition underlying natural information seeking. To address this gap, we explore how the integration of social cues into LLM-based search influences users' perceptions, experiences, and behaviors. Focusing on social media platforms that are beginning to adopt LLM-based search, we integrate design workshops, the implementation of the prototype system (SoulSeek), a between-subjects study, and mixed-method analyses to examine both outcome- and process-level findings. The workshop informs the prototype's cue-integrated design. The study shows that social cues improve perceived outcomes and experiences, promote reflective information behaviors, and reveal limits of current LLM-based search. We propose design implications emphasizing better social-knowledge understanding, personalized cue settings, and controllable interactions."}

Multi-agent systems can enhance efficiency through collaboration, but the scalability of motion-planning algorithms remains a key limitation. Reinforcement learning has been explored as a solution, but existing approaches are constrained by the limited input size required for effective learning, restricting their applicability to discrete environments. This work addresses that limitation by leveraging autoencoders to perform dimensionality reduction, compressing high-fidelity occupancy maps into latent state vectors while preserving essential spatial information. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedural generation algorithm based on Perlin noise, designed to generate topologically complex training environments that simulate asteroid fields, caves and forests. These environments are used for training the autoencoder and the navigation algorithm using a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for decentralized coordination. We introduce a weighted consensus mechanism that modulates reliance on shared data via a tuneable trust parameter, ensuring robustness to accumulation of errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system scales effectively with number of agents and generalizes well to unfamiliar, structurally distinct environments and is resilient in communication-constrained settings."}

There, agents may need to plan trajectories that balance their own path optimality with their ability to collect and share information about the environment that can help their teammates reach their own goals. To these ends, we propose ORION, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for cooperative multi-agent online navigation in partially known environments. Starting from an imperfect prior map, ORION trains agents to make decentralized decisions, coordinate to reach their individual targets, and actively reduce map uncertainty by sharing online observations in a closed perception-action loop. We first design a shared graph encoder that fuses prior map with online perception into a unified representation, providing robust state embeddings under dynamic map discrepancies. At the core of ORION is an option-critic framework that learns to reason about a set of high-level cooperative modes that translate into sequences of low-level actions, allowing agents to switch between individual navigation and team-level exploration adaptively. We further introduce a dual-stage cooperation strategy that enables agents to assist teammates under map uncertainty, thereby reducing the overall makespan. Across extensive maze-like maps and large-scale warehouse environments, our simulation results show that ORION achieves high-quality, real-time decentralized cooperation over varying team sizes, outperforming state-of-the-art classical and learning-based baselines. Finally, we validate ORION on physical robot teams, demonstrating its robustness and practicality for real-world cooperative navigation."}

However, existing approaches typically rely on handcrafted calibration targets (e.g., checkerboards) or specific, static scene types, limiting their adaptability and deployment in real-world autonomous and robotic applications. This article presents the first self-supervised LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration network that operates in an online fashion and eliminates the need for specific calibration targets. We first identify a significant generalization degradation problem in prior methods, caused by the conventional single-sided data augmentation strategy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel double-sided data augmentation technique that generates multi-perspective camera views using estimated depth maps, thereby enhancing robustness and diversity during training. Built upon this augmentation strategy, we design a dual-path, self-supervised calibration framework that reduces the dependence on high-precision ground truth labels and supports fully adaptive online calibration. Furthermore, to improve cross-modal feature association, we replace the traditional dual-branch feature extraction design with a difference map construction process that explicitly correlates LiDAR and camera features. This not only enhances calibration accuracy but also reduces model complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on five public benchmark datasets, as well as our own recorded dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of generalizability."}

For automating these tasks, service robots must be capable of manipulating arbitrary articulated objects. Recent deep learning methods have been shown to predict valuable priors on the affordance of articulated objects from vision. In contrast, many other works estimate object articulations by observing the articulation motion, but this requires the robot to already be capable of manipulating the object. In this article, we propose a novel approach combining these methods by using a factor graph for online estimation of articulation which fuses learned visual priors and proprioceptive sensing during interaction into an analytical model of articulation based on Screw Theory. With our method, a robotic system makes an initial prediction of articulation from vision before touching the object, and then quickly updates the estimate from kinematic and force sensing during manipulation. We evaluate our method extensively in both simulations and real-world robotic manipulation experiments. We demonstrate several closed-loop estimation and manipulation experiments in which the robot was capable of opening previously unseen drawers. In real hardware experiments, the robot achieved a 75% success rate for autonomous opening of unknown articulated objects."}

Due to the long and homogeneous characteristics of such scenarios, LiDAR measurements often provide weak geometric constraints, making traditional sensor fusion methods susceptible to accumulated motion estimation errors. To address these challenges, we propose AIMS, an adaptive LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry fusion method for robust quadrupedal robot localization in degenerate environments. The proposed method is formulated within an error-state Kalman filtering framework, where LiDAR and leg odometry measurements are integrated with IMU-based state prediction, and measurement noise covariance matrices are adaptively adjusted based on online degeneracy-aware reliability assessment. Experimental results obtained in narrow corridor environments demonstrate that the proposed method improves localization accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art approaches."}

Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation."}

However, existing end-to-end and hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies often rely on text-only cues while keeping plan intent latent, which undermines referential grounding in cluttered or underspecified scenes, impedes effective task decomposition of long-horizon goals with close-loop interaction, and limits causal explanation by obscuring the rationale behind action choices. To address these issues, we first introduce Visual Sketch, an implausible visual intermediate that renders points, boxes, arrows, and typed relations in the robot's current views to externalize spatial intent, connect language to scene geometry. Building on Visual Sketch, we present Action-Sketcher, a VLA framework that operates in a cyclic See-Think-Sketch-Act workflow coordinated by adaptive token-gated strategy for reasoning triggers, sketch revision, and action issuance, thereby supporting reactive corrections and human interaction while preserving real-time action prediction. To enable scalable training and evaluation, we curate diverse corpus with interleaved images, text, Visual Sketch supervision, and action sequences, and train Action-Sketcher with a multi-stage curriculum recipe that combines interleaved sequence alignment for modality unification, language-to-sketch consistency for precise linguistic grounding, and imitation learning augmented with sketch-to-action reinforcement for robustness. Extensive experiments on cluttered scenes and multi-object tasks, in simulation and on real-world tasks, show improved long-horizon success, stronger robustness to dynamic scene changes, and enhanced interpretability via editable sketches and step-wise plans.

This study investigates how avatar-based social representation in Virtual Reality (VR) influences coordination in threshold collective action problems. Through a randomized controlled experiment with 188 participants organized in 94 pairs, we examine whether brief avatar exposure affects perceived co-presence and coordination outcomes in a two-player threshold public goods game implemented as a real-effort recycling task. We manipulate a single design feature: participants either briefly interact through avatars before the main task (Pre-Task Avatar treatment) or complete an equivalent activity individually without peer visibility (No Pre-Task Avatar treatment). Our findings reveal that minimal avatar exposure significantly increases perceived co-presence and improves strategic coordination, though not through increased contribution quantity. Participants exposed to peer avatars achieve higher social welfare by coordinating to avoid wasteful over-contribution beyond the threshold. Additionally, we identify VR presence-the sense of 'being there' in the virtual environment-as a stronger predictor of task performance than co-presence itself. This research contributes to Information Systems theory by establishing causal pathways from specific design features to presence to coordination outcomes, demonstrates VR as a rigorous experimental methodology for IS research, and provides actionable insights for designing collaborative platforms supporting sustainability initiatives and threshold collective action problems."}

In-hand 6D object pose estimation is challenging because of heavy occlusion produced by the robot's grippers, which can have an adverse effect on methods that rely on vision data only. Many robots are equipped with tactile sensors at their fingertips that could be used to complement vision data. In this paper, we present a method that uses both tactile and vision data to estimate the pose of an object grasped in a robot's hand. To address challenges like lack of standard representation for tactile data and sensor fusion, we propose the use of point clouds to represent object surfaces in contact with the tactile sensor and present a network architecture based on pixel-wise dense fusion. We also extend NVIDIA's Deep Learning Dataset Synthesizer to produce synthetic photo-realistic vision data and corresponding tactile point clouds. Results suggest that using tactile data in addition to vision data improves the 6D pose estimate, and our network generalizes successfully from synthetic training to real physical robots."}

We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible \"explicit world model\" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations."}

In the planning stage, state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end autonomous driving models decouple planning into parallel lateral and longitudinal predictions. While effective, this parallel design can lead to i) coordination failures between the planned path and speed, and ii) underutilization of the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, thus redundantly encoding static information. To address this, we propose a novel cascaded framework that explicitly conditions longitudinal planning on the drive path, enabling coordinated and collision-aware lateral and longitudinal planning. Specifically, we introduce a path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates the drive path into longitudinal planning. Building on this, the model predicts longitudinal displacements along the drive path rather than full 2D trajectory waypoints. This design simplifies longitudinal reasoning and more tightly couples it with lateral planning. Additionally, we introduce a planning-oriented data augmentation strategy that simulates rare safety-critical events, such as vehicle cut-ins, by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets to avoid collision. Evaluated on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, our method sets a new SOTA, achieving a driving score of 89.07 and a success rate of 73.18%, demonstrating significantly improved coordination and safety"}

Existing methods either ingeniously match geometric priors or utilize sparse semantics to reduce FLoc uncertainty. However, they still suffer from ambiguous FLoc caused by repetitive structures within minimalist floorplans. Moreover, expensive but limited semantic annotations restrict their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DisCo-FLoc, which utilizes dual-level visual-geometric Contrasts to Disambiguate depth-aware visual Floc, without requiring additional semantic labels. Our solution begins with a ray regression predictor tailored for ray-casting-based FLoc, predicting a series of FLoc candidates using depth estimation expertise. In addition, a novel contrastive learning method with position-level and orientation-level constraints is proposed to strictly match depth-aware visual features with the corresponding geometric structures in the floorplan. Such matches can effectively eliminate FLoc ambiguity and select the optimal imaging pose from FLoc candidates. Exhaustive comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic-based method, achieving significant improvements in both robustness and accuracy."}

However, existing approaches often rely on global instructions to produce short-term control signals, which can result in misalignment in action generation. We conjecture that the primitive skills, referred to as fine-grained, short-horizon manipulations, such as ``move up'' and ``open the gripper'', provide a more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning. To bridge this gap, we propose SDP, a skill-conditioned DP that integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning. SDP abstracts eight reusable primitive skills across tasks and employs a vision-language model to extract discrete representations from visual observations and language instructions. Based on them, a lightweight router network is designed to assign a desired primitive skill for each state, which helps construct a single-skill policy to generate skill-aligned actions. By decomposing complex tasks into a sequence of primitive skills and selecting a single-skill policy, SDP ensures skill-consistent behavior across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on two challenging simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments demonstrate that SDP consistently outperforms SOTA methods, providing a new paradigm for skill-based robot learning with diffusion policies."}

However, real-world data is often noisy, making it difficult to obtain an accurate and unbiased approximation of the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator generated from noisy datasets is typically corrupted by noise-induced bias that severely degrades prediction and downstream tracking performance. In order to address this drawback, this paper proposes a novel autoencoder-based neural architecture to jointly learn the appropriate lifting functions and the reduced-bias Koopman operator from noisy data. The architecture initially learns the Koopman basis functions that are consistent for both the forward and backward temporal dynamics of the system. Subsequently, by utilizing the learned forward and backward temporal dynamics, the Koopman operator is synthesized with a reduced bias making the method more robust to noise compared to existing techniques. Theoretical analysis is used to demonstrate significant bias reduction in the presence of training noise. Dynamics prediction and tracking control simulations are conducted for multiple serial manipulator arms, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, to demonstrate its robustness under various noise levels. Experimental studies with the Franka FR3 7-DoF manipulator arm are further used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical setting."}

To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis. Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold. To mitigate empty grasping and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp detection during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands.

However, existing robotic face driving research primarily focuses on conversations or mimicking static expressions, struggling to meet the high demands for continuous emotional expression and coherence in singing. To address this, we propose a novel avatar-driven framework for appealing robotic singing. We first leverage portrait video generation models embedded with extensive human priors to synthesize vivid singing avatars, providing reliable expression and emotion guidance. Subsequently, these facial features are transferred to the robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions that span a wide expression space. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the emotional richness of robotic singing, we propose the Emotion Dynamic Range metric to measure the emotional breadth within the Valence-Arousal space, revealing that a broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances. Comprehensive experiments prove that our method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches."}

In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost vertical estimation framework leveraging differential barometric sensing integrated within a fully ROS-compliant software package. Our system simultaneously publishes real-time altitude data from both a stationary base station and a mobile sensor, enabling precise and drift-free vertical localization. Empirical evaluations conducted in challenging scenarios -- such as fully enclosed stairwells and elevators, demonstrate that our proposed barometric pipeline achieves sub-meter vertical accuracy (RMSE: 0.29 m) and perfect (100%) floor-level identification. In contrast, our results confirm that standalone height estimates, obtained solely from visual- or LiDAR-based SLAM odometry, are insufficient for reliable vertical localization. The proposed ROS-compatible barometric module thus provides a practical and cost-effective solution for robust vertical awareness in real-world robotic deployments. The implementation of our method is released as open source at https://github.com/witsir/differential-barometric."}

This work introduces CycleVLA, a system that equips Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with proactive self-correction, the capability to anticipate incipient failures and recover before they fully manifest during execution. CycleVLA achieves this by integrating a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking. Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.

However, conventional storytelling methods often lack the interactive elements necessary to engage students. To this end, this study examines the impact of an interactive digital storytelling system incorporating a human-like robot on student engagement and creativity. The study aims to compare engagement levels across three modalities: paper-based, PowerPoint, and robot-assisted storytelling, MotiBo. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, this work involves three groups of students who interact with the storytelling system over a five-day learning. Findings reveal that students using MotiBo exhibit statistically significant improvement in behavioural and cognitive engagement compared to those using traditional methods. These results suggest that the integration of novel technologies can effectively enhance the learning experience, ultimately promoting creativity and self-learning ability in educational settings. Future research will investigate the long-term effects of these technologies on learning outcomes and explore their potential for broader applications in diverse educational contexts."}

The research employs a quasi-experimental design involving NCS students who interact with an AI-driven, robot-assisted language learning system, LiveBo. The study aims to assess the impact of this innovative approach on active participation and motivation. Data are collected through proficiency tests, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Findings indicate that NCS students experience positive improvements in behavioural and emotional engagement, motivation and learning outcomes, highlighting the potential of integrating novel technologies in language education. We plan to compare with the control group in the future.

Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation."}
