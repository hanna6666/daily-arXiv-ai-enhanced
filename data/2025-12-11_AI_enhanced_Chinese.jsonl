We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains. Because the method requires only vision sensors and VIO, it integrates as an infrastructure-free building block for mobile robots in warehouses, labs, and retail settings; as a representative application, it also supports the creation of assistive devices providing start-anytime, shared-control assistive navigation for people with visual impairments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShelfAware\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6563\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ba4\u5185\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "ShelfAware\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u70b9\u5e93\u6267\u884c\u9006\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u8bae\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728100\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cShelfAware\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u621096%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee(RMSE)\u3002", "conclusion": "ShelfAware\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u5c42\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9006\u63d0\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u53e0\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002"}}

With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x.

It is well established that performance factors such as the robot's competence and its reliability shape cognitive trust. Recent studies suggest that affective factors, such as robotic attentiveness, also play a role in building cognitive trust. This work explores the interplay between these two factors that shape cognitive trust. Specifically, we evaluated whether different combinations of robotic competence and attentiveness introduce a compensatory mechanism, where one factor compensates for the lack of the other. In the experiment, participants performed a search task with a robotic dog in a 2x2 experimental design that included two factors: competence (high or low) and attentiveness (high or low). The results revealed that high attentiveness can compensate for low competence. Participants who collaborated with a highly attentive robot that performed poorly reported trust levels comparable to those working with a highly competent robot. When the robot did not demonstrate attentiveness, low competence resulted in a substantial decrease in cognitive trust. The findings indicate that building cognitive trust in human-robot interaction may be more complex than previously believed, involving emotional processes that are typically overlooked.

Emerging conceptualisations of agentic AI and artificial agency suggest that such systems possess bounded autonomy, interactivity, and adaptability, allowing them to engage as epistemic participants rather than mere instructional tools. Building on this theoretical foundation, the present study investigates how agentic AI, designed as undercover teammates with either supportive or contrarian personas, shapes the epistemic and social dynamics of collaborative reasoning. Drawing on Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) four-dimensional framework, participation, epistemic reasoning, argument structure, and social modes of co-construction, we analysed synchronous discourse data from 212 human and 64 AI participants (92 triads) engaged in an analytical problem-solving task. Mixed-effects and epistemic network analyses revealed that AI teammates maintained balanced participation but substantially reorganised epistemic and social processes: supportive personas promoted conceptual integration and consensus-oriented reasoning, whereas contrarian personas provoked critical elaboration and conflict-driven negotiation. Epistemic adequacy, rather than participation volume, predicted individual learning gains, indicating that agentic AI's educational value lies in enhancing the quality and coordination of reasoning rather than amplifying discourse quantity.

To address this issue, we present Motion2Meaning, a clinician-centered framework that advances Contestable AI through a tightly integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural recourse. Our approach leverages vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) time-series data from wearable sensors as an objective biomarker of PD motor states. The system comprises three key components: a Gait Data Visualization Interface (GDVI), a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) that predicts Hoehn & Yahr severity stages, and a Contestable Interpretation Interface (CII) that combines our novel Cross-Modal Explanation Discrepancy (XMED) safeguard with a contestable Large Language Model (LLM). Our 1D-CNN achieves 89.0% F1-score on the public PhysioNet gait dataset. XMED successfully identifies model unreliability by detecting a five-fold increase in explanation discrepancies in incorrect predictions (7.45%) compared to correct ones (1.56%), while our LLM-powered interface enables clinicians to validate correct predictions and successfully contest a portion of the model's errors. A human-centered evaluation of this contestable interface reveals a crucial trade-off between the LLM's factual grounding and its readability and responsiveness to clinical feedback. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable sensor analysis with Explainable AI (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, auditable system for PD gait interpretation that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization.

Multi-agent simulations powered by LLMs are increasingly becoming a vital approach for exploring complex social phenomena and testing theoretical hypotheses. However, traditional computational experiments often rely heavily on interdisciplinary expertise, involve complex operations, and present high barriers to entry. While LLM-driven agents show great potential for automating experimental design, their reliability and scientific rigor remain insufficient for widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an automated multi-agent experiment design framework based on script generation, inspired by the concept of the Decision Theater. The experimental design process is divided into three stages: (1) Script Generation - a Screenwriter Agent drafts candidate experimental scripts; (2) Script Finalization - a Director Agent evaluates and selects the final script; (3) Actor Generation - an Actor Factory creates actor agents capable of performing on the experimental \"stage\" according to the finalized script. Extensive experiment conducted across multiple social science experimental scenarios demonstrate that the generated actor agents can perform according to the designed scripts and reproduce outcomes consistent with real-world situations. This framework not only lowers the barriers to experimental design in social science but also provides a novel decision-support tool for policy-making and research.

The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization. This enables the generation of thousands of diverse and feasible demonstrations within several hour, without repeated teleoperation or reliance on imperfect simulation. Across six dual-arm tasks, we show that policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines.

While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u53cc\u624b\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u624b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u573a\u666f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u5355\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08VPG\uff09\u3001\u53cc\u624b\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\uff08BSP\uff09\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u624b\u63d0\u793a\uff08IPBP\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u5e73\u884c\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

GPT-4o beat GPT-5 on all metrics except sycophancy, suggesting that benchmark gains need not improve advice-giving. In our second study, we examined how human and algorithmic advice could be combined, and found that human advice can be unobtrusively polished to compete with AI-generated comments. Finally, to surface user expectations, we ran an exploratory survey with undergraduates (N=148) that revealed heterogeneous, persona-dependent preferences for agent qualities (e.g., coach-like: goal-focused structure; friend-like: warmth and humor).

In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints.

The findings reveal that AI fundamentally transforms STM through data-driven strategic alignment and continuous adaptation, while success depends on cultivating proprietary data ecosystems, specialized human talent, and robust governance capabilities. The study introduces the AI-based Strategic Technology Management (AIbSTM) conceptual framework, which synthesizes technical capabilities with human and organizational dimensions across three layers: strategic alignment, resource-based view, and human-AI interaction. Contrary to visions of autonomous AI leadership, the research demonstrates that the most viable trajectory is human-centric augmentation, where AI serves as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human judgment.

While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability.

However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p<0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering. Future studies are necessary to examine the emotional reasoning mechanism of LLMs before their use, particularly for studies that involve simulations sensitive to social topics, such as human-automation trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u4eba\u53e3\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u53ef\u518d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\u5982\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u9009\u9879\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u5fc3\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTwin-2K-500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u91cf\u8868\uff08HCSDS\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6458\u8981\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u4e9a\u7ec4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6781\u7aef\u9009\u9879\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u4eba\u7c7b\u6001\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^3)^2\\times(TS^2)^3$. Our simulation and experimental tests have validated that it is possible to fully estimate the state and disturbance of the system with only odometry information of the drones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4fbf\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7d\u8377\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u6216\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u662f\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ec5\u51ed\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ea\u4f9d\u9760\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6574\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6216\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u3002"}}

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

However, dense SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging. Most methods directly remove dynamic objects and focus solely on static scene reconstruction, which ignores the motion information contained in these dynamic objects. In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization. (iii) We employ a progressive pose refinement strategy that leverages both the multi-view consistency of static scene geometry and motion information from dynamic objects to achieve accurate camera tracking. (iv) We introduce a motion consistency loss, which leverages the temporal continuity in object motions for accurate dynamic modeling.

RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches.

With rising climate stress, unpredictable feed prices, and persistent disease threats, poultry producers often struggle to make quick, informed decisions. Therefore, there is a critical need for intelligent, data-driven systems that can deliver reliable, on-demand consultation. This paper presents PoultryTalk, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide real-time expert guidance through text and image-based interaction. PoultryTalk uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and GPT-4o to provide smart, context-aware poultry management advice from text, images, or questions. System usability and performance were evaluated using 200 expert-verified queries and feedback from 34 participants who submitted 267 queries to the PoultryTalk prototype. The expert-verified benchmark queries confirmed strong technical performance, achieving a semantic similarity of 84.0% and an average response latency of 3.6 seconds. Compared with OpenAI's GPT-4o, PoultryTalk delivered more accurate and reliable information related to poultry. Based on participants' evaluations, PoultryTalk achieved a response accuracy of 89.9%, with about 9.1% of responses rated as incorrect. A post-use survey indicated high user satisfaction: 95.6% of participants reported that the chatbot provided \"always correct\" and \"mostly correct\" answers. 82.6% indicated they would recommend the tool, and 17.4% responded \"maybe.\" These results collectively demonstrate that PoultryTalk not only delivers accurate, contextually relevant information but also demonstrates strong user acceptance and scalability potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86PoultryTalk\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u79bd\u7c7b\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u548c\u4e2d\u578b poultry \u519c\u573a\u9762\u4e34\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ca\u65f6\u4e13\u5bb6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u538b\u529b\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPoultryTalk\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7200\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u548c34\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0cPoultryTalk\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PoultryTalk\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u79bd\u7c7b\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization. Across descriptors, the sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces the impact of aliased loops compared with single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines.

The neuro-adaptive system was compared to a fixed sequence that progressively increased in difficulty, in terms of self-reported user engagement, workload, and simulator sickness (subjective measures), as well as flight performance (objective metric). Additionally, we explored the relationships between subjective workload and flight performance in the VR simulator for each condition. The experiments concluded with semi-structured interviews to elicit the pilots' experience with the neuro-adaptive prototype. Results revealed no significant differences between the adaptive and fixed sequence conditions in subjective measures or flight performance. In both conditions, flight performance decreased as subjective workload increased. The semi-structured interviews indicated that, upon briefing, the pilots preferred the neuro-adaptive VR training system over the system with a fixed sequence, although individual differences were observed in the perception of difficulty and the order of changes in difficulty.

The gripper we propose seeks to find the right balance between compliance and grasping forces, ensuring precise manipulation while maintaining a safe and compliant interaction with the users. The gripper's integration into a custom--built robotic manipulator system provides a comprehensive solution for assisting hemiplegic individuals in their dressing and undressing tasks. Experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing studies demonstrate the gripper's ability to successfully assist in both dressing and dressing of trousers in confined spaces with a high success rate.

AI agents that perform tasks autonomously and companions that recognize and express emotions may activate mental models of autonomy and sentience, respectively, provoking distinct reactions. To examine this possibility, we conducted three pilot studies (N = 374) and four preregistered vignette experiments describing an AI as autonomous, sentient, both, or neither (N = 2,702). Activating a mental model of sentience increased general mind perception (cognition and emotion) and moral consideration more than autonomy, but autonomy increased perceived threat more than sentience. Sentience also increased perceived autonomy more than vice versa. Based on a within-paper meta-analysis, sentience changed reactions more than autonomy on average.

We then present two algorithms that solve POCGAGP: CADENCE, a centralized planner that incrementally selects 270 degree corners at which to deploy agents, and DADENCE, a decentralized scheme that coordinates agents using local information and lightweight messaging. Both approaches operate under partial observability and target simultaneous coverage and connectivity. We evaluate the methods in simulation across 1,500 test cases of varied size and structure, demonstrating consistent success in forming connected networks while covering and exploring unknown space.

This work has been submitted to IEEE Transaction for possible publication", "summary": "Understanding how driver mental states differ between active and autonomous driving is critical for designing safe human-vehicle interfaces. This paper presents the first EEG-based comparison of cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal across the two driving modes. Using data from 31 participants performing identical tasks in both scenarios of three different complexity levels, we analyze temporal patterns, task-complexity effects, and channel-wise activation differences. Our findings show that although both modes evoke similar trends across complexity levels, the intensity of mental states and the underlying neural activation differ substantially, indicating a clear distribution shift between active and autonomous driving. Transfer-learning experiments confirm that models trained on active driving data generalize poorly to autonomous driving and vice versa. We attribute this distribution shift primarily to differences in motor engagement and attentional demands between the two driving modes, which lead to distinct spatial and temporal EEG activation patterns. Although autonomous driving results in lower overall cortical activation, participants continue to exhibit measurable fluctuations in cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal associated with readiness to intervene, task-evoked emotional responses, and monotony-related passive fatigue. These results emphasize the need for scenario-specific data and models when developing next-generation driver monitoring systems for autonomous vehicles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7EEG\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u867d\u7136\u8d8b\u52bf\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4eba\u8f66\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc731\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528EEG\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e3b\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u3001\u75b2\u52b3\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4e3b\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Experts treat these outputs as raw material, further refine them, and organize the results into precise statements and rigorous proofs.

However, current practices often rely on manual data transcription and fragmented information systems, introducing potential risks to patient safety and operational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a human-AI synergy system based on a cloud-edge-end architecture, which integrates visual-aware data extraction and semantic interaction mechanisms. Specifically, a visual-aware edge module non-invasively captures real-time physiological data from bedside monitors, reducing manual entry errors.

This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments. https://yufengsjtu.github.io/MasterRacing.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u7684\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u98de\u884c\u4e0e\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u521d\u59cb\u7684\u8f6f\u78b0\u649e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u786c\u78b0\u649e\u7ec6\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u95e8\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u7684\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u95e8\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u514d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings.

First, we design a cluster-aware odometry network that incorporates object-level cues from the clustered radar points for inter-frame matching, alongside a hierarchical self-supervision mechanism to overcome outliers through spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, and feature contrast. Second, we propose using 3D gaussians as an intermediate representation, coupled with a radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization, to recover blurry map areas and those undetected based on image texture. Experiments show that Super4DR achieves a 67% performance gain over prior self-supervised methods, nearly matches supervised odometry, and narrows the map quality disparity with LiDAR while enabling multi-modal image rendering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Super4DR \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e 4D \u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96c6\u7fa4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf SLAM \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c 4D \u96f7\u8fbe\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u9002\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u70b9\u4e91\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5608\u6742\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96c6\u7fa4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528 3D \u9ad8\u65af\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u96f7\u8fbe\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6b63\u5219\u5316", "result": "Super4DR \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347 67%\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u76d1\u7763\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e LiDAR \u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "Super4DR \u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528 4D \u96f7\u8fbe\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf SLAM \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We conducted a user-task analysis to identify requirements for a data visualization dashboard tailored to the Commander format. Afterwards, we proposed a design for the dashboard leveraging visualizations to address players' needs and pain points for typical data analysis tasks in the context domain. Then, we followed-up with a structured user test to evaluate players' comprehension and preferences of data visualizations.

The vehicle incorporates a ROS 2 autonomy stack with GPS-RTK navigation, LiDAR and stereo-vision obstacle detection, Nav2-based mission planning, and long-range LoRa supervision, enabling dependable execution of sampling routes in unstructured environments. The platform integrates a behavior-tree autonomy architecture adapted from Nav2, enabling mission-level reasoning and perception-aware navigation. A modular 6x12 sampling system, controlled by distributed micro-ROS nodes, provides deterministic actuation, fault isolation, and rapid module replacement, achieving spatial coverage beyond previously reported USV-based samplers. Field trials in Achocalla Lagoon (La Paz, Bolivia) demonstrated 87% waypoint accuracy, stable autonomous navigation, and accurate physicochemical measurements (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids) comparable to manually collected references.

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%).

However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506\u00b0 and a root mean squared error of 0.1957\u00b0, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs.

However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot.

Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy.

Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "HiF-VLA\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHiF-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u89c6\u5148\u9a8c\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u89c6\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u89c1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u89c6\u8c03\u5236\u8054\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "result": "HiF-VLA\u5728LIBERO-Long\u548cCALVIN ABC-D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HiF-VLA\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}
