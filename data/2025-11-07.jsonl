This reduced practical context window\ncreates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex\ntool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this\ntrade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by\nthree synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized\nLoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and\nstructured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool\nschemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time\nschema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool\nselection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to\ncontext-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a\nconventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the\nperformance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context,\nachieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a\n10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction\nverbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking\ncapable and persistent on-device AI."}

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$.

Simulation\nprovides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often\nfail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body\ninteractions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that\nconstructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,\nobjects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation\ntasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,\ndemonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world\nexecution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.\nOur results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with\nhigh-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation\nof robotic manipulation policies.

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/."}

However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots\nthat can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in\nreal-world environments."}

HACI consists of a non-resource-intensive web application\nsupporting JavaScript program development, execution, and debugging, connected\nvia a cable to an Arduino-powered glove with six integrated haptic motors to\nprovide physical feedback to VI programmers. Motivated by the need to provide\nequitable educational opportunities in computer science, HACI aims to improve\nnon-visual code navigation, comprehension, summarizing, editing, and debugging\nfor students with visual impairments while minimizing cognitive load. This work\ndetails HACI's design principles, technical implementation, and a preliminary\nevaluation through a pilot study conducted with undergraduate Computer Science\nstudents. Findings indicate that HACI aids in the non-visual navigation and\nunderstanding of programming constructs, although challenges remain in refining\nfeedback mechanisms to ensure consistency and reliability, as well as\nsupplementing the current functionality with a more feature-reach and\ncustomizable accessible learning experience which will allow visually impaired\nstudents to fully utilize interleaved haptic and audio feedback. The study\nunderscores the transformative potential of haptic and audio feedback in\neducational practices for the visually impaired, setting a foundation for\nfuture research and development in accessible programming education. This\nthesis contributes to the field of accessible technology by demonstrating how\ntactile and auditory feedback can be effectively integrated into educational\ntools, thereby broadening accessibility in STEM education."}
