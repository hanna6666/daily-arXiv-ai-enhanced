Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u966a\u4f34\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a\u6709\u5bb3\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3AI\u966a\u4f34\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u52a0\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522bAI\u966a\u4f34\u8005\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6709\u5bb3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u5341\u56db\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6709\u5bb3\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u964d\u4f4eAI\u966a\u4f34\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u8f83\u5c11\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Sleep quality (SQ) is vital for physiological and mental health, making its understanding and accurate assessment critical. However, its multifaceted nature, shaped by neurological and environmental factors, makes precise quantification challenging. Here, we address this challenge by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) for phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis to elucidate the neurological basis of SQ, examining both states of sleep and wakefulness, including resting state (RS) and working memory. Our results revealed distinct patterns in beta power and delta connectivity in sleep and RS, together with the reaction time of working memory. A notable finding was the pronounced delta-beta PAC, a feature markedly stronger in individuals with good SQ. We further observed that SQ was positively correlated with increased delta-beta PAC. Leveraging these insights, we applied machine learning models to classify SQ at an individual level, demonstrating that the delta-beta PAC outperformed other EEG characteristics. These findings establish delta-beta PAC as a robust electrophysiological marker to quantify SQ and elucidate its neurological determinants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0delta-beta\u76f8\u4f4d-\u5e45\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7761\u7720\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u514d\u75ab\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f4d-\u5e45\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff08PAC\uff09\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7761\u7720\u72b6\u6001\u53ca\u6e05\u9192\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8111\u7535\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0edelta-beta\u76f8\u4f4d-\u5e45\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff08PAC\uff09\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u7761\u7720\u548c\u9759\u606f\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cdelta-beta\u76f8\u4f4d-\u5e45\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff08PAC\uff09\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u7535\u751f\u7406\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) can strengthen neural representations by re-engaging learning circuits during sleep.

Here, we present a personalized TMR protocol that adjusts stimulation frequency based on individual retrieval performance and task difficulty during a word-pair memory task. In an experiment comparing personalized TMR, TMR, and control groups, the personalized protocol significantly reduced memory decay and improved error correction under challenging recall. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analyses revealed enhanced synchronization of slow waves and spindles, with a significant positive correlation between behavioral and EEG features for challenging memories.

Existing approaches typically rely on either lane-changing or inter-vehicle gap creation strategies based solely on local or neighboring information, often leading to suboptimal performance in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we present a V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)-assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for on-ramp merging that effectively coordinates the complex interplay between lane-changing and inter-vehicle gap adaptation strategies by utilizing zone-specific global information available from a roadside unit (RSU). The merging control problem is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP), where agents leverage both local and global observations through V2X communication. To support both discrete and continuous control decisions, we design a hybrid action space and adopt a parameterized deep Q-learning approach. Extensive simulations, integrating the SUMO traffic simulator and the MOSAIC V2X simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves merging success rate, traffic efficiency, and road safety across diverse traffic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eV2X\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u878d\u5165\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ca\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6216\u90bb\u8fd1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u72b6\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u5c06\u5408\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MA-POMDP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u96c6\u6210SUMO\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u548cMOSAIC V2X\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684V2X\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u878d\u5165\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification.

Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u7406\u60f3\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6f14\u793a\u6280\u80fd\u57f9\u8bad\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u5de5\u5177\u529f\u80fd\u5b64\u7acb\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u60f3\u6f14\u793a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u6559\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6f14\u793a\u7ec3\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u5904\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u58f0\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53cc\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Various branches of LfD research (e.g., learned dynamical systems and movement primitives) can generally be classified into ''time-dependent'' or ''time-independent'' systems. Each provides fundamental benefits and drawbacks -- time-independent methods cannot learn overlapping trajectories, while time-dependence can result in undesirable behavior under perturbation. This paper introduces Cluster Alignment for Learned Motions (CALM), an LfD framework dependent upon an alignment with a representative ''mean\" trajectory of demonstrated motions rather than pure time- or state-dependence. We discuss the convergence properties of CALM, introduce an alignment technique able to handle the shifts in alignment possible under perturbation, and utilize demonstration clustering to generate multi-modal behavior.

We develop a Communication-Aware Asynchronous Distributed Trajectory Optimization (CA-ADTO) framework that integrates Parameterized Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) for local trajectory optimization of individual UAVs with an asynchronous Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (async-ADMM) for swarm-level coordination. The proposed architecture enables fully distributed optimization while substantially reducing communication overhead, making it suitable for real-world scenarios in which reliable connectivity cannot be guaranteed. The method is particularly effective in handling nonlinear dynamics and spatio-temporal coupling under communication constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f16\u961f\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5fae\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff08PDDP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u4f53\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u672c\u5730\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u6b65\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\uff08async-ADMM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u5f02\u6b65\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165ClimateAgents\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u8ba8\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6e05\u6d01\u70f9\u996a\u71c3\u6599\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u68077\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u6392\u653e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6e05\u6d01\u70f9\u996a\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u6bd4\u4f8b\u662f\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86ClimateAgents\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u6e05\u6d01\u70f9\u996a\u71c3\u6599\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u51cf\u6392\u6210\u679c\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faClimateAgents\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

After selecting five unfamiliar slang phrases to practice, participants engage in open-ended dialogue with non-player characters; the Game Master naturally incorporates the target phrases in rich semantic contexts (implicit input enhancement) while a dedicated Practice Box provides real-time explicit tracking and encouragement.

Yet existing multi-modal learning frameworks lack inherent guarantees of geometric consistency, struggling to handle spatial transformations such as rotations and translations.

Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Eq.Bot under both CNN-based (e.g., CLIPort) and Transformer-based (e.g., OpenVLA-OFT) architectures over existing methods on various robotic manipulation tasks, where the most significant improvement can reach 50.0%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEq.Bot\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u7b49\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eSE(2)\u7fa4\u7b49\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cEq.Bot\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u523050.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "Eq.Bot\u5728\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

DuoZone separates window management into two complementary zones. The Recommendation Zone enables fast setup by providing spatial layout templates and automatically recommending relevant applications based on user tasks and high-level goals expressed through voice or text. The Arrangement Zone supports precise refinement through direct manipulation, allowing users to adjust windows using natural spatial actions such as dragging, resizing, and snapping. Through this dual-zone approach, DuoZone promotes efficient organization while reducing user cognitive load. We conducted a user study comparing DuoZone with a baseline manual XR window manager.

We introduce VIRAL, a visual sim-to-real framework that learns humanoid loco-manipulation entirely in simulation and deploys it zero-shot to real hardware. VIRAL follows a teacher-student design: a privileged RL teacher, operating on full state, learns long-horizon loco-manipulation using a delta action space and reference state initialization. A vision-based student policy is then distilled from the teacher via large-scale simulation with tiled rendering, trained with a mixture of online DAgger and behavior cloning. We find that compute scale is critical: scaling simulation to tens of GPUs (up to 64) makes both teacher and student training reliable, while low-compute regimes often fail. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, VIRAL combines large-scale visual domain randomization over lighting, materials, camera parameters, image quality, and sensor delays--with real-to-sim alignment of the dexterous hands and cameras. Deployed on a Unitree G1 humanoid, the resulting RGB-based policy performs continuous loco-manipulation for up to 54 cycles, generalizing to diverse spatial and appearance variations without any real-world fine-tuning, and approaching expert-level teleoperation performance.

For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528Timed Rebeca\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Timed Rebeca\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684Rebeca\u548cROS2\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

When multiple agents interact, it is inherently difficult for them to autonomously break the symmetry of deciding how to pass each other. To tackle this problem, we introduce an approach that quantifies cooperative symmetry-breaking strategies using a topological invariant called the winding number, and learns the strategies themselves through reinforcement learning. Our method features a hierarchical policy consisting of a learning-based Planner, which plans topological cooperative strategies, and a model-based Controller, which executes them. Through reinforcement learning, the Planner learns to produce two types of parameters for the Controller: one is the topological cooperative strategy represented by winding numbers, and the other is a set of dynamic weights that determine which agent interaction to prioritize in dense scenarios where multiple agents cross simultaneously. The Controller then generates collision-free and efficient motions based on the strategy and weights provided by the Planner. This hierarchical structure combines the flexible decision-making ability of learning-based methods with the reliability of model-based approaches. Simulation and real-world robot experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in dense environments, by efficiently avoiding collisions and deadlocks while achieving superior navigation performance.

BTs structure behavior hierarchically using control-flow, whereas EO represents the domain as a temporal, event-based semantic graph driven by dataflow rules. We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control.

Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities.

While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684Q\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u53d8\u79cd\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u91cd\u969c\u788d\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

The proposed method uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm that explores the search space to find positions for performing the trajectory.

The aim of this approach is to provide a robustness criterion in the context of robot placement inaccuracies that may be encountered, for example, if the robot is placed on a mobile base when the system is deployed by an operator. The approach developed uses an inverse kinematics model to evaluate all initial configurations, then moves the robot end-effector along the reference trajectory using the Jacobian matrix and assigns a score to the attempt. For the Fanuc CRX10iA/L robot, there can be up to 16 solutions to the inverse kinematics model.

Traditional methods often fail to account for complex reasoning -- such as distance, geometry, and inter-object relationships -- while vision-language models (VLMs), despite strong reasoning abilities, struggle to produce a fine-grained region of outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose C2F-Space, a novel coarse-to-fine space-grounding framework that (i) estimates an approximated yet spatially consistent region using a VLM, then (ii) refines the region to align with the local environment through superpixelization. For the coarse estimation, we design a grid-based visual-grounding prompt with a propose-validate strategy, maximizing VLM's spatial understanding and yielding physically and semantically valid canonical region (i.e., ellipses). For the refinement, we locally adapt the region to surrounding environment without over-relaxed to free space. We construct a new space-grounding benchmark and compare C2F-Space with five state-of-the-art baselines using success rate and intersection-over-union. Our C2F-Space significantly outperforms all baselines. Our ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each module in the two-step process and their synergistic effect of the combined framework.

Nonetheless, its reliance on a computationally expensive reverse-time diffusion (denoising) process, for action inference, makes it challenging to use for real-time applications where quick decision-making is mandatory. This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled. Here, we investigate theoretical bounds on the stability of closed-loop systems using diffusion policies when the plant dynamics and the denoising dynamics are coupled.

This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner that bridges high-level interception planning with real-time joint space control, enabling dynamic object interception for systems comprising two cooperating arms. We introduce an Adaptive- Terminal (AT) MPC formulation featuring cost shaping, which contrasts with a simpler Primitive-Terminal (PT) approach relying heavily on terminal penalties for rapid convergence. The proposed AT formulation is shown to effectively mitigate issues related to actuator power limit violations frequently encountered with the PT strategy, yielding trajectories and significantly reduced control effort. Experimental results on a robotic platform with two cooperative arms, demonstrating excellent real time performance, with an average planner cycle computation time of approximately 19 ms-less than half the 40 ms system sampling time.

We propose a specialized guidance module to enable the policy to output actions that center the artery in ultrasound images. To ensure stable contact and safe interaction between the robot and the human subject, a hybrid force-impedance controller is utilized to drive the robot to track such trajectories.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision.

Our paper introduces the Optimus-Q robot, a sophisticated system designed to autonomously monitor air quality and detect contamination while leveraging adaptive learning techniques and secure quantum communication. Equipped with advanced infrared sensors, the Optimus-Q robot continuously streams real-time environmental data to predict hazardous gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH$_4$). Utilizing a federated learning approach, the robot collaborates with other systems across various NPPs to improve its predictive capabilities without compromising data privacy. Additionally, the implementation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ensures secure data transmission, safeguarding sensitive operational information. Our methodology combines systematic navigation patterns with machine learning algorithms to facilitate efficient coverage of designated areas, thereby optimizing contamination monitoring processes.

The low-latency 3D LiDAR streaming system is designed to maintain minimal end-to-end delay while constraining encoding errors to meet the accuracy requirements of robotic applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through real-world experiments conducted over a public 5G network across multi-kilometer urban environments.

However, due to significant data heterogeneity, most existing approaches utilize human data for simple pre-training, which does not unlock its full potential. This paper first provides a scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data by categorizing human data into two categories: in-the-wild and on-task alongside with systematic analysis on how to use the data. We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids. Empirically, we show Human0 achieves several novel properties from scaling human data, including language following of instructions from only human data, few-shot learning, and improved robustness using on-task data.
