Existing solutions attempt to incorporate\nexplicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these\napproaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and\nincomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that\nestimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of\ndepth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective\nalignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial\ncomprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth\nestimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric\nrepresentations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing\nalignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial\nrepresentations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in\nsimulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs.

Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and\nsafe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional\ntip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to\nreach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a\nphysics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented\nNeural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian\ncomputation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller\nleverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone\nconformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager\nfurther enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,\nsuch as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive\nsimulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse\nscenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and\nshape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom\nvalidate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall\ncontacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and\nexisting baselines.

We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information\nPotential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and\nbuild upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths\nat specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot\nactions.

Recent GBC methods often\nemploy diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are\ngenerated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without\nreplanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and\ngeneralization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action\nsampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures.

Twenty participants of\nvarying skill levels performed 3D modeling tasks using both systems. The\nresults showed that while the average task completion time is comparable for\nboth groups, novice designers had a higher completion rate in AR-CAD than in\nthe traditional CAD interface, and experienced designers had a similar\ncompletion rate in both systems. A statistical comparison of task completion\nrate, time, and NASA Task Load Index (TLX) showed that AR-CAD slightly reduced\ncognitive load while favoring a high task completion rate. Higher scores on the\nSystem Usability Scale (SUS) by novices indicated that AR-CAD was superior and\nworthwhile for reducing barriers to entering CAD. In contrast, the Traditional\nCAD interface was favored by experienced users for its advanced capabilities,\nwhile many viewed AR-CAD as a valid means for rapid concept development,\neducation, and an initial critique of designs. This opens up the need for\nfuture research on the needed refinement of AR-CAD with a focus on\nhigh-precision input tools and its evaluation of complex design processes.

Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes\nmultidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process\ngenerates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional\nextraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object\nattributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To\naddress this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature\nextraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.\nThis strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external\nobject features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional\nreconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring\ncontact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and\neffective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying\nshapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N\nrange). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition\naccuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in\nactual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%.

We developed an AI-based\njudge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),\nand deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against\nhuman expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on\n$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we\nfound no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the\ntwo approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated\n$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an\nexcellent match.

Extensive experiments on a\ndiverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success\nrate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per\nsecond on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing\nbaselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across\nembodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,\nthe high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,\nunderscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for\ndexterous grasping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86T(R,O) Grasp\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u6293\u53d6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9006\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "T(R,O) Grasp\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5177\u670994.83%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c0.21\u79d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "T(R,O) Grasp\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7075\u5de7\u6293\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7075\u5de7\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This reasoning requires to\nestimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners\ngenerate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by\noptimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires\na cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a\ncost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex\nurban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego\nproposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal\ntrajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,\nwe introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling\nconsistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost\nfunction design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,\nrequiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms.
