Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized B\u00fcchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \\times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \\times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3MITL\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3aMDP\u548cPOMDP\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MITL\u516c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aTimed-LDGBA\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u7528\u4e8eQ\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec5x5\u7684MDP\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u300110x10\u7684POMDP\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u670d\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u8f83\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This compositional paradigm spans diverse domains, from multi-step manipulation planning to panoramic image synthesis to long video generation. However, compositional generative models face a critical challenge: when local distributions are multimodal, existing composition methods average incompatible modes, producing plans that are neither locally feasible nor globally coherent. We propose Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS), which addresses this \\emph{mode averaging} problem by embedding search directly within the diffusion denoising process. Our method explores diverse combinations of local modes through population-based sampling, prunes infeasible candidates using likelihood-based filtering, and enforces global consistency through iterative resampling between overlapping segments. CDGS matches oracle performance on seven robot manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines that lack compositionality or require long-horizon training data. The approach generalizes across domains, enabling coherent text-guided panoramic images and long videos through effective local-to-global message passing.

However, in many applications, such areas of interest are unknown and should be identified online during exploration. Thus, this paper considers the problem of simultaneous exploration, inspection of unknown environments and then real-time communication to a mobile ground control station to report the findings. The heterogeneous robots are equipped with different sensors, e.g., long-range lidars for fast exploration and close-range cameras for detailed inspection. Furthermore, global communication is often unavailable in such environments, where the robots can only communicate with each other via ad-hoc wireless networks when they are in close proximity and free of obstruction. This work proposes a novel planning and coordination framework (SLEI3D) that integrates the online strategies for collaborative 3D exploration, adaptive inspection and timely communication (via the intermit-tent or proactive protocols). To account for uncertainties w.r.t. the number and location of features, a multi-layer and multi-rate planning mechanism is developed for inter-and-intra robot subgroups, to actively meet and coordinate their local plans. The proposed framework is validated extensively via high-fidelity simulations of numerous large-scale missions with up to 48 robots and 384 thousand cubic meters.

Previous efforts for perching on vertical surfaces have predominantly focused on lightweight mechanical design solutions with relatively scant system-level integration.

This work presents the preliminary investigation of a perching approach suitable for larger drones that both gently perches on vertical tree trunks and reacts and recovers from perch failures. The system in this work, called SLAP, consists of vision-based perch site detector, an IMU (inertial-measurement-unit)-based perch failure detector, an attitude controller for soft perching, an optical close-range detection system, and a fast active elastic gripper with microspines made from commercially-available slapbands. We validated this approach on a modified 1.2 kg commercial quadrotor with component and system analysis.

Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u8f66\u8f86\u55b7\u6f06\u8def\u5f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u751f\u4ea7\u5de5\u5382\uff0c\u8f66\u8f86\u55b7\u6f06\u5de5\u827a\u9700\u8981\u591a\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f66\u8eab\u55b7\u6f06\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8def\u5f84\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u55b7\u6f06\u8def\u5f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0a\u5c42\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff08VRP\uff09\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u8be6\u7ec6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u55b7\u6f06\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u5546\u4e1a\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u55b7\u6f06\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u624b\u5de5\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f86\u55b7\u6f06\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u55b7\u6f06\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR.

In practical situations with limited GNSS signals or degraded lighting conditions, the navigation solution may rely only on inertial sensors and as result drift in time due to errors in the inertial measurement. In this work, we propose WiCHINS, a wheeled and chassis inertial navigation system by combining wheel-mounted-inertial sensors with a chassis-mounted inertial sensor for accurate pure inertial navigation. To that end, we derive a three-stage framework, each with a dedicated extended Kalman filter. This framework utilizes the benefits of each location (wheel/body) during the estimation process. To evaluate our proposed approach, we employed a dataset with five inertial measurement units with a total recording time of 228.6 minutes. We compare our approach with four other inertial baselines and demonstrate an average position error of 11.4m, which is $2.4\\%$ of the average traveled distance, using two wheels and one body inertial measurement units.

Extended Reality (XR) applications, often used with head-mounted displays like Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, can limit the field of view (FOV) of players. We conducted a study to investigate the effects of limited FOV on co-presence, gesture recognition, overall enjoyment, and reaction time.\n  Initially, we observed experienced musicians collaborating informally with and without visual occlusion, noting that collaboration suffered with limited FOV. We then conducted a within-subjects study with 19 participants, comparing an unrestricted FOV holographic setup called HoloJam to Nreal AR glasses with a 52$^{\\circ}$ limited FOV. In the AR setup, we tested two conditions: standard AR with a 52$^{\\circ}$ FOV and a modified AR notification system called Mini Musicians.\n  Results showed that HoloJam provided higher co-presence, quicker gesture recognition, and greater enjoyment. The Mini Musicians application reduced reaction time and maintained enjoyment compared to the standard AR setup. We conclude that limited FOV impacts musical collaboration, but notifications can improve reaction time and should be considered in future XR music collaborations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u5bf9\u97f3\u4e50\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHoloJam\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u611f\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800cMini Musicians\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5219\u5728\u6807\u51c6AR\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u5b9e\u6280\u672f\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u95f4\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdAR\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\u5177\u670952\u00b0\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u7684Nreal AR\u773c\u955c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u89c6\u91ce\u7684HoloJam\u5168\u606f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "HoloJam\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u611f\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u53ca\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6109\u60a6\u611f\uff0c\u800cMini Musicians\u5219\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u5f71\u54cd\u97f3\u4e50\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684XR\u97f3\u4e50\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002"}}

We propose a replaceable bit-based gripper system to tackle the challenge of weight-based handling of cluttered food items. The gripper features specialized food attachments(bits) that enhance its grasping capabilities, and a belt replacement system allows switching between different food items during packaging operations. It offers a wide range of control options, enabling it to grasp and drop specific weights of granular, cluttered, and entangled foods. We specifically designed bits for two flexible food items that differ in shape: ikura(salmon roe) and spaghetti. They represent the challenging categories of sticky, granular food and long, sticky, cluttered food, respectively. The gripper successfully picked up both spaghetti and ikura and demonstrated weight-specific dropping of these items with an accuracy over 80% and 95% respectively.

However, their rapid deployment has outpaced understanding of the associated socio-technical risks, including transparency, reliability, patient autonomy, workflow alignment, and organizational governance. A clearer analysis of these risks is needed to support safe and equitable integration into healthcare practice. This study synthesizes interdisciplinary evidence from technical performance research, regulatory and ethical standards, clinical workflow analyses, and organizational policy guidance. The synthesis was used to develop a multi-layered socio-technical conceptual framework for evaluating and governing STT systems. Findings show that STT systems operate within tightly coupled socio-technical environments in which model performance, clinician oversight, patient rights, workflow design, and institutional governance are interdependent. The study offers a structured socio-technical governance framework and an implementation roadmap that outlines readiness assessment, vendor evaluation, pilot deployment, clinician training, ongoing monitoring, and iterative improvement. The framework emphasizes safeguards that protect patient autonomy, documentation integrity, and institutional trust while enabling the efficient and beneficial use of STT technologies.

There are already many old, no longer functional spacecraft and debris orbiting the earth, which endanger both the safe operation of satellites and space travel.

This work builds on the recent advances of autonomous agents deployed in resource-constrained platforms and shows a first simplified approach how such intelligent and autonomous nano-satellite swarms can be realized.

Many digital mental health tools struggle to support this process because rigid scripts fail to accommodate how users naturally describe stressors. This study examined the feasibility of an LLM-based single-session intervention (SSI) for workplace stress reappraisal. We assessed short-term changes in stress-related outcomes and examined design tensions during use. We conducted a feasibility study with 100 employees at a large technology company who completed a structured cognitive reappraisal session delivered by a GPT-4o-based chatbot. Pre-post measures included perceived stress intensity, stress mindset, perceived demand, and perceived resources. These outcomes were analyzed using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with correction for multiple comparisons. We also examined sentiment and stress trajectories across conversation quartiles using two RoBERTa-based classifiers and an LLM-based stress rater. Open-ended responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results showed significant reductions in perceived stress intensity and significant improvements in stress mindset. Changes in perceived resources and perceived demand trended in expected directions but were not statistically significant. Automated analyses indicated consistent declines in negative sentiment and stress over the course of the interaction. Qualitative findings suggested that participants valued the structured prompts for organizing thoughts, gaining perspective, and feeling acknowledged. Participants also reported tensions around scriptedness, preferred interaction length, and reactions to AI-driven empathy. These findings highlight both the promise and the design constraints of integrating LLMs into DMH interventions for workplace settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u804c\u573a\u538b\u529b\u518d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u538b\u529b\u5fc3\u6001\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7d27\u5f20\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u6570\u5b57\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5de5\u5177\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u538b\u529b\u6e90\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9100\u540d\u5458\u5de5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-4o\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u518d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u914d\u5bf9Wilcoxon\u79e9\u548c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u77ed\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u538b\u529b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u804c\u573a\u538b\u529b\u518d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u529b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u538b\u529b\u5fc3\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6570\u5b57\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Hybrid Factor Graphs give us a mathematical framework to model these types of problems, however existing approaches for solving them are based on approximations. In this work, we propose an efficient Hybrid Factor Graph framework alongwith a variable elimination algorithm to produce a hybrid Bayes network, which can then be used for exact Maximum A Posteriori estimation and marginalization over both sets of variables. Our approach first develops a novel hybrid Gaussian factor which can connect to both discrete and continuous variables, and a hybrid conditional which can represent multiple continuous hypotheses conditioned on the discrete variables. Using these representations, we derive the process of hybrid variable elimination under the Conditional Linear Gaussian scheme, giving us exact posteriors as hybrid Bayes network. To bound the number of discrete hypotheses, we use a tree-structured representation of the factors coupled with a simple pruning and probabilistic assignment scheme, which allows for tractable inference. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a SLAM dataset with ambiguous measurements, where discrete choices for the most likely measurement have to be made.

AI-featuring applications received significantly lower ratings than traditional applications (d = 0.40); however, hierarchical regression revealed a hidden pattern - the negative relationship reversed after controlling for AI mentions and review characteristics (b = 0.405, p < .001). Privacy dominated user concerns (34.8% of concern-expressing reviews), while efficiency represented the primary benefit (42.3%). Effects varied greatly by category, from positive for Assistant applications (d = 0.55) to negative for Entertainment (d = -0.23).

Qualitative results show that the integrated stack can perform end-to-end task execution from user instruction to multi-store navigation and object retrieval, while remaining modular and debuggable through its text-based map and logged decision history.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u8d2d\u7269\u4efb\u52a1\u63a2\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf7\u6c42\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8d2d\u7269\u8bf7\u6c42\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Gazebo \u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 ROS \u72b6\u6001\u673a\u6267\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u5230\u591a\u5e97\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u6267\u884c\u5b8c\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u65e5\u5fd7\u51b3\u7b56\u5386\u53f2\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8bd5\u6027\u3002"}}

However, many government and non-government websites that provide critical services - such as education, healthcare, and public administration - continue to exhibit significant accessibility and usability barriers. This study evaluates the accessibility of Bangladeshi government and non-government websites under WCAG~2.2 by combining automated accessibility assessments with user-reported feedback. A total of 212 websites were analyzed using multiple automated tools, complemented by a survey of 103 users to capture real-world usability, accessibility, and security experiences. The results reveal substantial disparities between government and non-government websites, highlighting persistent issues related to navigation complexity, interaction cost, visual readability, accessibility feature adoption, and authentication mechanisms. While non-government websites generally demonstrate better usability and functional performance, accessibility support remains inconsistent across both categories. The findings underscore the need for regular accessibility audits, user-centered design practices, and policy-driven interventions to improve digital inclusivity and ensure equitable access to online services for diverse user populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u5b98\u65b9\u7f51\u7ad9\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5b9a\u671f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u5b57\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u5173\u952e\u670d\u52a1\u7f51\u7ad9\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6027\u53ca\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408", "result": "\u5206\u6790212\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u7f51\u7ad9\u5728\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02", "conclusion": "\u653f\u5e9c\u4e0e\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u7f51\u7ad9\u5728\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u671f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u5305\u5bb9\u6027"}}

In Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), the objective is typically to minimize the makespan by generating non-overlapping paths for full-area coverage. However, most existing methods assume uniform importance across regions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where some zones require faster attention. We introduce the Priority-Aware MCPP (PA-MCPP) problem, where a subset of the environment is designated as prioritized zones with associated weights. The goal is to minimize, in lexicographic order, the total priority-weighted latency of zone coverage and the overall makespan. To address this, we propose a scalable two-phase framework combining (1) greedy zone assignment with local search, spanning-tree-based path planning, and (2) Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to standard MCPP baselines, while maintaining competitive makespan. Sensitivity analyses further show that the method scales well with the number of robots and that zone coverage behavior can be effectively controlled by adjusting priority weights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u533a\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d2a\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6811\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u65af\u5766\u7eb3\u6811\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u52a0\u6743\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u5de5\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Although deep learning methods have achieved high accuracy in seizure detection, most existing approaches remain seizure-centric, rely on discrete-label supervision, and are primarily evaluated using accuracy-based metrics. A central limitation of current EEG modeling practice is the weak correspondence between learned representations and how EEG findings are interpreted and summarized in clinical workflows. Harmful EEG activity exhibits overlapping patterns, graded expert agreement, and temporal persistence, which are not well captured by classification objectives alone. This work proposes a multimodal EEG representation learning framework that integrates signal-domain modeling with structured clinical language supervision. First, raw EEG is transformed into a longitudinal bipolar montage and time-frequency representations. Second, dual transformer-based encoders model complementary temporal and frequency-centric dependencies and are fused using an adaptive gating mechanism. Third, EEG embeddings are aligned with structured expert consensus descriptions through a contrastive objective. Finally, an EEG-conditioned text reconstruction loss is introduced as a representation-level constraint alongside standard classification loss. Experimental evaluation using a controlled train-validation-test split achieves a six-class test accuracy of 0.9797. Ablation analyses show that removing contrastive alignment reduces cross-modal retrieval performance from Recall@10 of 0.3390 to 0.0045, despite minimal change in classification accuracy.

This paper presents a comprehensive navigation and control framework for an LSMR that ensures stability and safety-defined performance, delivering robust operation on slip-prone terrain by jointly leveraging high-performance techniques. The proposed architecture comprises four main modules: (1) a visual pose-estimation module that fuses onboard sensors and stereo cameras to provide an accurate, low-latency robot pose, (2) a high-level nonlinear model predictive control that updates the wheel motion commands to correct robot drift from the robot reference pose on slip-prone terrain, (3) a low-level deep neural network control policy that approximates the complex behavior of the wheel-driven actuation mechanism in LSMRs, augmented with robust adaptive control to handle out-of-distribution disturbances, ensuring that the wheels accurately track the updated commands issued by high-level control module, and (4) a logarithmic safety module to monitor the entire robot stack and guarantees safe operation. The proposed low-level control framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation subsystem, while the safety module ensures the whole system-level safety during operation.

Participants interacted with a robot that failed to understand their prompts three times in succession, with their behavioral responses video-recorded and analyzed. We found both similarities and differences compared to adult responses from the original study. Like adults, children adjusted their prompts, modified their verbal tone, and exhibited increasingly emotional non-verbal responses throughout successive errors. However, children demonstrated more disengagement behaviors, including temporarily ignoring the robot or actively seeking an adult.

In real-world robotic domains, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) \\textbf{RoboReward}, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a \\emph{negative examples data augmentation} pipeline that generates calibrated \\emph{negatives} and \\emph{near-misses} via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we produce an extensive training and evaluation dataset that spans diverse tasks and embodiments and enables systematic evaluation of whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robotics. Our evaluation of leading open-weight and proprietary VLMs reveals that no model excels across all tasks, underscoring substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B-parameter reward VLM in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a frontier physical reasoning VLM trained on robotics data, by a large margin, while substantially narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86RoboReward\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6539\u8fdb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u8bb0\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86RoboReward\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d1f\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u526a\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8d1f\u4f8b\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5931\u8d25\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u76844B\u548c8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684VLM\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fd8\u662f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u76848B\u53c2\u6570\u5956\u52b1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002"}}

Submitted to RA-L", "summary": "Deformable scenes violate the rigidity assumptions underpinning classical visual-inertial odometry (VIO), often leading to over-fitting to local non-rigid motion or severe drift when deformation dominates visual parallax. We introduce DefVINS, a visual-inertial odometry framework that explicitly separates a rigid, IMU-anchored state from a non--rigid warp represented by an embedded deformation graph. The system is initialized using a standard VIO procedure that fixes gravity, velocity, and IMU biases, after which non-rigid degrees of freedom are activated progressively as the estimation becomes well conditioned. An observability analysis is included to characterize how inertial measurements constrain the rigid motion and render otherwise unobservable modes identifiable in the presence of deformation. This analysis motivates the use of IMU anchoring and informs a conditioning-based activation strategy that prevents ill-posed updates under poor excitation. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of combining inertial constraints with observability-aware deformation activation, resulting in improved robustness under non-rigid environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "DefVINS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u521a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u521a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u975e\u521a\u6027\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u7a0b\uff08VIO\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u573a\u666f\u662f\u521a\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u672c\u5730\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6216\u5f53\u53d8\u5f62\u4e3b\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u5dee\u65f6\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDefVINS\u7684VIO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u521a\u6027IMU\u951a\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7531\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u975e\u521a\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6VIO\u8fc7\u7a0b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u6fc0\u6d3b\u975e\u521a\u6027\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u60ef\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u521a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86IMU\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}
