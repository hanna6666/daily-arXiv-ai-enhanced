### [1] [When Thinking Pays Off: Incentive Alignment for Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09612)
*Joshua Holstein,Patrick Hemmer,Gerhard Satzger,Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现人类对AI的过度依赖削弱了人机互补，提出新激励机制可显著减少这种过度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与AI协作中的过度依赖问题及其驱动因素，寻求改善激励机制以提升决策质量。

Method: 通过180名参与者的行为实验评估激励机制的效果。

Result: 本文研究了人工智能（AI）在各个领域对人类决策的影响，发现人类对AI建议的过度依赖削弱了人类与AI的互补潜力。研究识别了这一现象的结构驱动因素，即人类－AI决策中的激励结构不匹配。为了应对这一问题，提出了一种新的激励机制并通过180名参与者的行为实验进行了实证评估，结果表明该机制显著减少了过度依赖现象，同时阐明了激励设计的重要性。

Conclusion: 有效的协作需要根据任务背景和人机互补性调整激励设计，避免不良激励导致的行为扭曲。

Abstract: Collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) has improved human decision-making across various domains by leveraging the complementary capabilities of humans and AI. Yet, humans systematically overrely on AI advice, even when their independent judgment would yield superior outcomes, fundamentally undermining the potential of human-AI complementarity. Building on prior work, we identify prevailing incentive structures in human-AI decision-making as a structural driver of this overreliance. To address this misalignment, we propose an alternative incentive mechanism designed to counteract systemic overreliance. We empirically evaluate this approach through a behavioral experiment with 180 participants, finding that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces overreliance. We also show that while appropriately designed incentives can enhance collaboration and decision quality, poorly designed incentives may distort behavior, introduce unintended consequences, and ultimately degrade performance. These findings underscore the importance of aligning incentives with task context and human-AI complementarities, and suggest that effective collaboration requires a shift toward context-sensitive incentive design.

### [2] [Co-Designing Multimodal Systems for Accessible Remote Dance Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09658)
*Ujjaini Das,Shreya Kappala,Meng Chen,Mina Huh,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究旨在为盲人和低视力舞者制定可及的舞蹈教学系统，通过与参与者共同设计，提出了舞蹈学习的设计建议和系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在使盲人和低视力学习者能够更好地参与舞蹈学习，解决现有视频教学在视觉上的限制。

Method: 通过与28名BLV舞者、教练及声音、触觉和音频描述专家进行三次共同设计研讨会，获取参与者的设计方案。

Result: 参与者设计了8个系统，揭示了共同主题，包括分阶段学习、为动作创作词汇、选择性使用不同的教学模式。

Conclusion: 提出了使舞蹈学习可及的设计建议。

Abstract: Videos make exercise instruction widely available, but they rely on visual demonstrations that blind and low vision (BLV) learners cannot see. While audio descriptions (AD) can make videos accessible, describing movements remains challenging as the AD must convey \textit{what} to do (mechanics, location, orientation) and \textit{how} to do it (speed, fluidity, timing). Prior work thus used \textit{multimodal instruction} to support BLV learners with individual simple movements. However, it is unclear how these approaches scale to dance instruction with unique, complex movements and precise timing constraints. To inform accessible remote dance instruction systems, we conducted three co-design workshops (N=28) with BLV dancers, instructors, and experts in sound, haptics, and AD. Participants designed 8 systems revealing common themes: staged learning to dissect routines, crafting vocabularies for movements, and selectively using modalities (narration for movement structure, sound for expression, and haptics for spatial cues). We conclude with design recommendations to make learning dance accessible.

### [3] [How AI Responses Shape User Beliefs: The Effects of Information Detail and Confidence on Belief Strength and Stance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09667)
*Zekun Wu,Mayank Jobanputra,Vera Demberg,Jessica Hullman,Anna Maria Feit*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过在线实验探讨AI生成回应的细节和信心对信念变化的影响，发现两者的组合对信念变化有显著作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI生成的回应如何通过细微特征影响人们的信念，特别是细节和信心等特征。

Method: 进行了一个预注册的在线实验，参与者为304人，使用了信念转换和信念偏移两种分析指标。

Result: 详细回应与中等信心关联的信念变化最大，而高度自信的回应更倾向于引发信念转变但较少引起立场反转。

Conclusion: 不同的AI回应属性以微妙但潜在重要的方式与用户信念相互作用，在设计大型语言模型驱动的系统时需考虑这些伦理和实践问题。

Abstract: The growing use of AI-generated responses in everyday tools raises concern about how subtle features such as supporting detail or tone of confidence may shape people's beliefs. To understand this, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment (N = 304) investigating how the detail and confidence of AI-generated responses influence belief change. We introduce an analysis framework with two targeted measures: belief switch and belief shift. These distinguish between users changing their initial stance after AI input and the extent to which they adjust their conviction toward or away from the AI's stance, thereby quantifying not only categorical changes but also more subtle, continuous adjustments in belief strength that indicate a reinforcement or weakening of existing beliefs. Using this framework, we find that detailed responses with medium confidence are associated with the largest overall belief changes. Highly confident messages tend to elicit belief shifts but induce fewer stance reversals. Our results also show that task type (fact-checking versus opinion evaluation), prior conviction, and perceived stance agreement further modulate the extent and direction of belief change. These findings illustrate how different properties of AI responses interact with user beliefs in subtle but potentially consequential ways and raise practical as well as ethical considerations for the design of LLM-powered systems.

*Gabrielle M Gauthier,Eesha Ali,Amna Asim,Sarah Cornell-Maier,Lori A. Zoellner*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 内容审核员面临较高的心理健康风险，需通过改进工作环境和应对策略来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索内容审核员在工作环境中接触痛苦内容后，工作上下文对其心理健康结果的影响。

Method: 研究了166名国际样本及45名美国样本内容审核员的心理健康状况，比较了数据标注者及技术支持工作人员的数据。

Result: 内容审核员的PTSD、抑郁症、躯体症状和酒精误用的诊断率显著高于对照组，影响因素包括负面自动思维、持续压力和逃避应对。

Conclusion: 组织环境和个人应对方式影响心理健康风险，建议采取结构性和技术性干预措施来保护内容审核员的心理健康。

Abstract: Human content moderators (CMs) routinely review distressing digital content at scale. Beyond exposure, the work context (e.g., workload, team structure, and support) may shape mental health outcomes. We examined a cross sectional international CM sample (N = 166) and a U.S. prospective CM sample, including a comparison group of data labelers or tech support workers (N = 45) and gold standard diagnostic interviews. Predictors included workplace factors (e.g., hours per day distressing content, culture), cognitive-affective individual differences, and coping. Across samples, probable diagnoses based on validated clinical cutoffs were elevated (PTSD: 25.9 to 26.3%; depression: 42.1 to 48.5%; somatic symptoms: 68.7 to 89.5%; alcohol misuse: 10.5% to 18.3%). In the U.S. sample, CMs had higher interviewer rated PTSD severity (d = 1.50), likelihood of a current mood disorder (RR = 8.22), and lifetime major depressive disorder (RR = 2.15) compared to data labelers/tech-support workers. Negative automatic thoughts (b = .39 to .74), ongoing stress (b = .27 to .55), and avoidant coping (b = .30 to .34) consistently predicted higher PTSD and depression severity across samples and at 3 month followup. Poorer perceived workplace culture was associated with higher depression (b = -.16 to -.32). These findings strongly implicate organizational context and related individual response styles, not exposure dose alone in shaping risk. We highlight structural and technological interventions such as limits on daily exposure, supportive team culture, interface features to reduce intrusive memories, and training of cognitive restructuring and adaptive coping to support mental health. We also connect implications to adjacent human in the loop data work (e.g., AI red teaming), where similar risks are emerging.

### [5] [Real-Time Lightweight Gaze Privacy-Preservation Techniques Validated via Offline Gaze-Based Interaction Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09846)
*Mehedi Hasan Raju,Oleg V. Komogortsev*

Motivation: 研究实时隐私保护技术的有效性，以减少眼动数据中的身份相关信息，同时提高基于注视的交互效果。

Method: 通过一个离线眼动数据集进行实验，评估身份识别率和交互信号质量来验证实时隐私化技术的效果。

Result: 提出了一个功能框架，可以在已收集的离线数据集上研究实时注视隐私化的有效性，并引入轻量级的卡尔曼滤波框架。

Conclusion: 使用轻量级卡尔曼滤波器进行的隐私保护方案有效降低了身份相关信息，同时提升了注视互动性能。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of the real-time privacy-preserving techniques through an offline gaze-based interaction simulation framework. Those techniques aim to reduce the amount of identity-related information in eye-tracking data while improving the efficacy of the gaze-based interaction. Although some real-time gaze privatization methods were previously explored, their validation on the large dataset was not conducted. We propose a functional framework that allows to study the efficacy of real-time gaze privatization on an already collected offline dataset. The key metric used to assess the reduction of identity-related information is the identification rate, while improvements in gaze-based interactions are evaluated through signal quality during interaction. Our additional contribution is the employment of an extremely lightweight Kalman filter framework that reduces the amount of identity-related information in the gaze signal and improves gaze-based interaction performance.

### [6] [Quantitative and Qualitative Comparison of Generative Models for Subject-Specific Gaze Synthesis: Diffusion vs GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09867)

Result: 提出了改进的扩散和生成对抗网络方法，使其能够更好地生成个性化的注视数据。

Conclusion: 通过严谨的评估，这些改进有助于定义合成信号的质量、真实性和个体特性，推动基于注视的应用发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning demonstrate the ability to generate synthetic gaze data. However, most approaches have primarily focused on generating data from random noise distributions or global, predefined latent embeddings, whereas individualized gaze sequence generation has been less explored. To address this gap, we revisit two recent approaches based on diffusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and introduce modifications that make both models explicitly subject-aware while improving accuracy and effectiveness. For the diffusion-based approach, we utilize compact user embeddings that emphasize per-subject traits. Moreover, for the GAN-based approach, we propose a subject-specific synthesis module that conditioned the generator to retain better idiosyncratic gaze information. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of these modified approaches utilizing standard eye-tracking signal quality metrics, including spatial accuracy and precision. This work helps define synthetic signal quality, realism, and subject specificity, thereby contributing to the potential development of gaze-based applications.

TL;DR: 本研究发现，盲人在通过智能手机触摸屏解读触觉格纹时表现优越，表明可以利用这种触觉刺激来帮助盲人理解图形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过触觉反馈帮助盲人理解图形信息。

Method: 通过两项实验比较视觉障碍者和正常视力者在智能手机触摸屏上识别触觉格纹的能力。

Result: 视觉障碍者在触觉敏感度上优于视力正常者，能够更好地识别触觉格纹。

Conclusion: 触觉格纹刺激有潜力为视觉障碍者提供可解读的图形呈现方式，推动人机交互和感官适应研究。

Abstract: Providing haptic feedback via smartphone touch screen may potentially offer blind people a capability to understand graphs. This study investigated the discrimination performance of haptic gratings in different frequencies, in both visually impaired (VI) and sighted (S) individuals. 6 VI participants and 10 S participants took part in two experiments designed to compare their ability to interpret grating images with a finger swiping across a smartphone touchscreen without vision. The swipe gesture activates phone vibration temporally synchronized with the black stripes. Their tasks were: (1) determining whether a grating pattern is presented on the touchscreen, (2) comparing two different grating frequencies and determining the wider one. Results demonstrated that the VI group exhibited superior tactile sensitivity compared to the S group, as evidenced by their significantly better performance in Experiment 1 (accuracy of 99.15\% vs. 84.5\%). Experiment 2 revealed that the peak performance of VI participants was approximately around 0.270 cycles per mm (83.3\% accuracy), a frequency very similar to Braille dot spacing, while S group peaked around 0.963 cycles per mm (70\% accuracy). The findings suggest that tactile stimulation coded with grating patterns could be potentially used to present interpretable graph for the visually impaired. Such an approach could offer a value to research in human-computer interaction and sensory adaptation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 道德偏好会随时间变化，缺乏对这些变化的认识会对AI对齐带来挑战，尤其在医疗等高风险领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着道德偏好的变化，确保AI系统的对齐至关重要，以提升其可信度，尤其在医疗等重要领域。

Method: 通过在肾脏分配领域进行实验，收集400多名参与者的反应，分析其道德偏好的变化及其对AI模型预测性能的影响。

Result: 本研究探讨了人类道德偏好的动态变化及其对AI对齐的影响，尤其在高风险应用中，这种变化可能导致系统的不可信任和严重的社会危害。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，AI在面对人类道德偏好变化时，需要考虑这些变化的性质和时间因素，以改善AI对齐。

Abstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for "legitimate" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting "response instability"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing "model instability"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了互联网测量研究中研究人员如何面对伦理挑战，并提出了相应的应对策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解互联网测量研究中涉及的伦理决策，以保障研究的伦理性和有效性。

Method: 通过对欧盟一个互联网测量研究小组的16位研究人员进行访谈并进行主题分析。

Result: 通过对16位研究人员的访谈，共同识别出五个主要的伦理挑战，并讨论了他们的应对策略。

Conclusion: 伦理要求在不同机构和地区存在差异，伦理审查委员会的技术知识不足以评估互联网测量研究的复杂性。

Abstract: Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了住宅需求响应计划的有效性，发现住户的行为受到热环境变化及非热因素的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究住宅部门需求响应计划（DRPs）的有效性及其受到住户行为影响的机制，以适应可再生能源和气候变化带来的新挑战。

Method: 采用生态瞬时评估法（EMA）收集住户在日常生活中对热环境变化的即时反应及动机，通过统计分析识别动机与偏好和住户交互之间的关联。

Result: 通过对20个家庭进行的三个月观察，分析了住户在不同情况下对热环境的反应及其动机，发现非热因素在住户行为中占重要地位。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了在需求响应计划中整合非热因素的重要性，呼吁对现有住户行为模型进行重新评估。

Abstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于AI的预测输入方法，旨在通过减少精细运动来解决重复性劳损（RSI）问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管经过多年的人体工程学鼠标设计，RSI问题仍未得到解决，因此探讨是否通过预测输入来减轻这一问题。

Method: 引入了一种零点击互动范式（PAD），允许用户预览预测的GUI目标，通过时间释放键来选择或丢弃这些目标。

Result: 在浏览器邮箱客户端和ISO 9241-9键盘预测任务中，PAD相较于标准触控板使用显著减少了手部运动。

Conclusion: PAD显著减少了手部运动，并在类似最佳拼写检查器的准确度下保持了与触控板相似的任务时间。

Abstract: Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.

TL;DR: 通过对1000名参与者的大规模实验，我们发现用户更倾向于与具有相似意见的AI助手互动，并认为这些助手更值得信赖和有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to understand how AI personalization, driven by machine learning, affects user interactions and perceptions

Method: conducting a large-scale controlled experiment with 1,000 participants interacting with AI assistants

Result: participants preferred to interact with AI that shared their opinions and found them more trustworthy and competent; weak effects of AI personality alignment were observed

Conclusion: 意见一致性是AI个性化和用户偏好的核心维度，同时需要深入讨论个性化AI的局限性和风险。

Abstract: Interactions with AI assistants are increasingly personalized to individual users. As AI personalization is dynamic and machine-learning-driven, we have limited understanding of how personalization affects interaction outcomes and user perceptions. We conducted a large-scale controlled experiment in which 1,000 participants interacted with AI assistants that took on certain personality traits and opinion stances. Our results show that participants consistently preferred to interact with models that shared their opinions. Participants also found opinion-aligned models more trustworthy, competent, warm, and persuasive, corroborating an AI-similarity-attraction hypothesis. In contrast, we observed no or only weak effects of AI personality alignment, with introvert models rated as less trustworthy and competent by introvert participants. These findings highlight opinion alignment as a central dimension of AI personalization and user preference, while underscoring the need for a more grounded discussion of the limits and risks of personalized AI.

Conclusion: ScaleADFG框架在模拟和真实机器人实验中表现出强适应性，并能有效实现零-shot转移。

Abstract: Dexterous functional tool-use grasping is essential for effective robotic manipulation of tools. However, existing approaches face significant challenges in efficiently constructing large-scale datasets and ensuring generalizability to everyday object scales. These issues primarily arise from size mismatches between robotic and human hands, and the diversity in real-world object scales. To address these limitations, we propose the ScaleADFG framework, which consists of a fully automated dataset construction pipeline and a lightweight grasp generation network. Our dataset introduce an affordance-based algorithm to synthesize diverse tool-use grasp configurations without expert demonstrations, allowing flexible object-hand size ratios and enabling large robotic hands (compared to human hands) to grasp everyday objects effectively. Additionally, we leverage pre-trained models to generate extensive 3D assets and facilitate efficient retrieval of object affordances. Our dataset comprising five object categories, each containing over 1,000 unique shapes with 15 scale variations. After filtering, the dataset includes over 60,000 grasps for each 2 dexterous robotic hands. On top of this dataset, we train a lightweight, single-stage grasp generation network with a notably simple loss design, eliminating the need for post-refinement. This demonstrates the critical importance of large-scale datasets and multi-scale object variant for effective training. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robot confirm that the ScaleADFG framework exhibits strong adaptability to objects of varying scales, enhancing functional grasp stability, diversity, and generalizability. Moreover, our network exhibits effective zero-shot transfer to real-world objects. Project page is available at https://sizhe-wang.github.io/ScaleADFG_webpage

Abstract: We present the ongoing development of a robotic system for overhead work such as ceiling drilling. The hardware platform comprises a mobile base with a two-stage lift, on which a bimanual torso is mounted with a custom-designed drilling end effector and RGB-D cameras. To support teleoperation in dynamic environments with limited visibility, we use Gaussian splatting for online 3D reconstruction and introduce motion parameters to model moving objects. For safe operation around dynamic obstacles, we developed a neural configuration-space barrier approach for planning and control. Initial feasibility studies demonstrate the capability of the hardware in drilling, bolting, and anchoring, and the software in safe teleoperation in a dynamic environment.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，仅依靠好奇心驱动的内在信号可以有效推动机器人自主的多模态学习，仿效婴儿从随机运动到有目的行为的进化过程。

Abstract: Inspired by infant development, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for autonomous self-exploration in a robotic agent, Baby Sophia, using the BabyBench simulation environment. The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors.

Abstract: Dynamical system (DS)-based learning from demonstration (LfD) is a powerful tool for generating motion plans in the operation (`task') space of robotic systems. However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture on the LASA and IROS handwriting datasets.

Result: 本文提出了一种新的自动规划框架，针对动态和不均匀信息衰减环境中自主机器人的信息收集任务进行优化，提高了安全性和信息获取效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同环境中实验显示了卓越的安全性和有效的信息获取能力。

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for information-gathering tasks in environments that vary across space and time. Planning informative and safe trajectories in such settings is challenging because information decays when regions are not revisited. Most existing planners model information as static or uniformly decaying, ignoring environments where the decay rate varies spatially; those that model non-uniform decay often overlook how it evolves along the robot's motion, and almost all treat safety as a soft penalty. In this paper, we address these challenges. We model uncertainty in the environment using clarity, a normalized representation of differential entropy from our earlier work that captures how information improves through new measurements and decays over time when regions are not revisited. Building on this, we present Stein Variational Clarity-Aware Informative Planning, a framework that embeds clarity dynamics within trajectory optimization and enforces safety through a low-level filtering mechanism based on our earlier gatekeeper framework for safety verification. The planner performs Bayesian inference-based learning via Stein variational inference, refining a distribution over informative trajectories while filtering each nominal Stein informative trajectory to ensure safety. Hardware experiments and simulations across environments with varying decay rates and obstacles demonstrate consistent safety and reduced information deficits.

Abstract: Amphibians adapt their morphologies and motions to accommodate movement in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Inspired by these biological features, we present PuffyBot, an untethered shape morphing robot capable of changing its body morphology to navigate multiple environments. Our robot design leverages a scissor-lift mechanism driven by a linear actuator as its primary structure to achieve shape morphing. The transformation enables a volume change from 255.00 cm3 to 423.75 cm3, modulating the buoyant force to counteract a downward force of 3.237 N due to 330 g mass of the robot. A bell-crank linkage is integrated with the scissor-lift mechanism, which adjusts the servo-actuated limbs by 90 degrees, allowing a seamless transition between crawling and swimming modes. The robot is fully waterproof, using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fabric to ensure functionality in aquatic environments. The robot can operate untethered for two hours with an onboard battery of 1000 mA h. Our experimental results demonstrate multi-environment locomotion, including crawling on the land, crawling on the underwater floor, swimming on the water surface, and bimodal buoyancy adjustment to submerge underwater or resurface. These findings show the potential of shape morphing to create versatile and energy efficient robotic platforms suitable for diverse environments.

Motivation: 为了提升视觉运动策略的泛化能力，我们探讨现有方法在不同场景布局因素下的表现，意识到数据的多样性对训练效果的重要性。

Method: 我们创建了一个较为全面的随机化数据集，涵盖多种操作机器人和夹具类型，通过自动生成仅需少量人类示范来提高数据的多样性。

Result: 发现场景的随机化因素对策略的泛化能力有显著影响，应用时可提升政策的适应性，尤其是在零-shot仿真到现实迁移的场景中。

Conclusion: 通过应用不同形式的随机化，尤其是多样化的轨迹，可以显著提升策略的泛化能力，这为实现零-shot从仿真到现实的迁移提供了支持。

Abstract: The generalization ability of visuomotor policy is crucial, as a good policy should be deployable across diverse scenarios. Some methods can collect large amounts of trajectory augmentation data to train more generalizable imitation learning policies, aimed at handling the random placement of objects on the scene's horizontal plane. However, the data generated by these methods still lack diversity, which limits the generalization ability of the trained policy. To address this, we investigate the performance of policies trained by existing methods across different scene layout factors via automate the data generation for those factors that significantly impact generalization. We have created a more extensively randomized dataset that can be efficiently and automatically generated with only a small amount of human demonstration. The dataset covers five types of manipulators and two types of grippers, incorporating extensive randomization factors such as camera pose, lighting conditions, tabletop texture, and table height across six manipulation tasks. We found that all of these factors influence the generalization ability of the policy. Applying any form of randomization enhances policy generalization, with diverse trajectories particularly effective in bridging visual gap. Notably, we investigated on low-cost manipulator the effect of the scene randomization proposed in this work on enhancing the generalization capability of visuomotor policies for zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Motivation: 目前大多数视觉语言行动模型在感知交互和动态过程方面存在局限，因此需要引入音频信息以提升动态过程的感知能力。

Method: 采用Audio-VLA模型，结合视觉编码器DINOv2、SigLIP和音频编码器AudioCLIP，以及大语言模型Llama2，通过LoRA微调实现跨模态理解；并引入多模态投影层对不同模态特征进行对齐。

Result: 在LIBERO、RLBench和两个真实任务上的广泛实验表明，Audio-VLA在性能上显著优于仅依赖视觉的方法，同时TCR指标有效地量化了动态过程的感知能力。

Conclusion: Audio-VLA在动态过程感知方面优于传统仅依赖视觉的模型，而TCR指标能够系统性地评估操作过程的动态性。

Abstract: The Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have achieved significant advances in robotic manipulation recently. However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLA模型在物理传感器攻击下的显著脆弱性，并提出了基于对抗训练的防御机制以增强模型的鲁棒性，同时强调了在安全关键环境中建立标准化鲁棒性基准和缓解策略的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.
  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.

Then we evaluate the performance of the DecARt Leg-based robot via extensive simulation and preliminary hardware experiments.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于Kolmogorov Arnold网络的机器学习方法，用于机器人关节的静态摩擦建模，具有高准确性和可解释性，适用于未知功能结构的情况，具有工程应用潜力。

Abstract: Friction modeling plays a crucial role in achieving high-precision motion control in robotic operating systems. Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions. This study provides a new perspective for interpretable and data-driven robotic friction modeling with promising engineering applicability.

On the D4RL benchmark, UEPO achieves +5.9\% absolute improvement over Uni-O4 on locomotion tasks and +12.4\% on dexterous manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.

Conclusion: MT3在模仿学习中表现出色，能够以高效的方式学习和泛化多样化的日常任务。

Abstract: Humans are remarkably efficient at learning tasks from demonstrations, but today's imitation learning methods for robot manipulation often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations per task. We investigate two fundamental priors for improving learning efficiency: decomposing manipulation trajectories into sequential alignment and interaction phases, and retrieval-based generalisation. Through 3,450 real-world rollouts, we systematically study this decomposition. We compare different design choices for the alignment and interaction phases, and examine generalisation and scaling trends relative to today's dominant paradigm of behavioural cloning with a single-phase monolithic policy. In the few-demonstrations-per-task regime (<10 demonstrations), decomposition achieves an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency over single-phase learning, with retrieval consistently outperforming behavioural cloning for both alignment and interaction. Building on these insights, we develop Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer (MT3), an imitation learning method based on decomposition and retrieval. MT3 learns everyday manipulation tasks from as little as a single demonstration each, whilst also generalising to novel object instances. This efficiency enables us to teach a robot 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstrator time. Through 2,200 additional real-world rollouts, we reveal MT3's capabilities and limitations across different task families.

Abstract: Recent advances in closed-loop planning benchmarks have significantly improved the evaluation of autonomous vehicles. However, existing benchmarks still rely on rule-based reactive agents such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which lack behavioral diversity and fail to capture realistic human interactions, leading to oversimplified traffic dynamics. To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving. We further reimplement a collection of rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid planning approaches within our nuPlan-R benchmark, providing a clearer reflection of planner performance in complex interactive scenarios and better highlighting the advantages of learning-based planners in handling complex and dynamic scenarios. These results establish nuPlan-R as a new standard for fair, reactive, and realistic closed-loop planning evaluation. We will open-source the code for the new benchmark.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功减少了OOD性能差距，并提高了在分布内表现。

Abstract: Methods for trajectory prediction in Autonomous Driving must contend with rare, safety-critical scenarios that make reliance on real-world data collection alone infeasible. To assess robustness under such conditions, we propose new long-tail evaluation settings that repartition datasets to create challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets. We first introduce a safety-informed scenario factorization framework, which disentangles scenarios into discrete ego and social contexts. Building on analogies to compositional zero-shot image-labeling in Computer Vision, we then hold out novel context combinations to construct challenging closed-world and open-world settings. This process induces OOD performance gaps in future motion prediction of 5.0% and 14.7% in closed-world and open-world settings, respectively, relative to in-distribution performance for a state-of-the-art baseline. To improve generalization, we extend task-modular gating networks to operate within trajectory prediction models, and develop an auxiliary, difficulty-prediction head to refine internal representations. Our strategies jointly reduce the OOD performance gaps to 2.8% and 11.5% in the two settings, respectively, while still improving in-distribution performance.

Abstract: Bolting operations are critical in industrial assembly and in the maintenance of scientific facilities, requiring high precision and robustness to faults. Although robotic solutions have the potential to improve operational safety and effectiveness, current systems still lack reliable autonomy and fault management capabilities. To address this gap, we propose a control framework for dependable robotized bolting tasks and instantiate it on a specific robotic system. The system features a control architecture ensuring accurate driving torque control and active compliance throughout the entire operation, enabling safe interaction even under fault conditions. By designing a multimodal human-robot interface (HRI) providing real-time visualization of relevant system information and supporting seamless transitions between automatic and manual control, we improve operator situation awareness and fault detection capabilities. A high-level supervisor (SV) coordinates the execution and manages transitions between control modes, ensuring consistency with the supervisory control (SVC) paradigm, while preserving the human operator's authority. The system is validated in a representative bolting operation involving pipe flange joining, under several fault conditions. The results demonstrate improved fault detection capabilities, enhanced operator situational awareness, and accurate and compliant execution of the bolting operation. However, they also reveal the limitations of relying on a single camera to achieve full situational awareness.

Abstract: Origami-inspired mechanisms can transform flat sheets into functional three-dimensional dynamic structures that are lightweight, compact, and capable of complex motion. These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes. The optimized structure achieves improved throwing performance, illustrating how our system enables rapid, simulation-driven origami design, optimization, and analysis.

To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.

Motivation: 在现实世界中，双足机器人面临摔倒的风险，尽管在稳健运动方面有了进展。大多数研究集中在预防摔倒事件上，但我们转而关注摔倒本身。

Method: 采用一种基于模拟的采样策略，针对初始和最终姿态进行采样，以提高政策的鲁棒性并支持在推断时指定任意未见的终态。

Result: 提出了一种与机器人无关的奖励函数，用于在强化学习中平衡实现所需终态与减少冲击、保护关键机器人部件，成功实现控制的软着陆。

Conclusion: 通过模拟和现实世界实验，验证了双足机器人在不同摔倒条件下可实现受控、柔和的着陆。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in robust locomotion, bipedal robots operating in the real world remain at risk of falling. While most research focuses on preventing such events, we instead concentrate on the phenomenon of falling itself. Specifically, we aim to reduce physical damage to the robot while providing users with control over a robot's end pose. To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.
