### [1] [Eyes on Many: Evaluating Gaze, Hand, and Voice for Multi-Object Selection in Extended Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12406)
*Mohammad Raihanul Bashar,Aunnoy K Mutasim,Ken Pfeuffer,Anil Ufuk Batmaz*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了扩展现实中的多对象选择技术，发现DoublePinch与Gaze+Pinch组合效果最佳，语音命令使用虽有优势但体验不佳，提供了设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高用户与多个对象的交互效率，并理解设计选择如何影响用户表现。

Method: 通过用户研究，评估四种模式切换技术（SemiPinch, FullPinch, DoublePinch, Voice）和三种子选择技术（Gaze+Dwell, Gaze+Pinch, Gaze+Voice）对用户性能的影响。

Result: 用户研究结果表明，不同的模式切换和子选择技术对用户性能有显著影响，特别是DoublePinch与Gaze+Pinch组合表现最佳。

Conclusion: 本研究发现，DoublePinch与Gaze+Pinch组合下用户性能最佳，SemiPinch性能最低，而虽然Voice模式切换有优势，但Gaze+Voice的选择技术并不受欢迎，因其重复的语音命令被认为乏味。

Abstract: Interacting with multiple objects simultaneously makes us fast. A pre-step to this interaction is to select the objects, i.e., multi-object selection, which is enabled through two steps: (1) toggling multi-selection mode -- mode-switching -- and then (2) selecting all the intended objects -- subselection. In extended reality (XR), each step can be performed with the eyes, hands, and voice. To examine how design choices affect user performance, we evaluated four mode-switching (SemiPinch, FullPinch, DoublePinch, and Voice) and three subselection techniques (Gaze+Dwell, Gaze+Pinch, and Gaze+Voice) in a user study. Results revealed that while DoublePinch paired with Gaze+Pinch yielded the highest overall performance, SemiPinch achieved the lowest performance. Although Voice-based mode-switching showed benefits, Gaze+Voice subselection was less favored, as the required repetitive vocal commands were perceived as tedious. Overall, these findings provide empirical insights and inform design recommendations for multi-selection techniques in XR.

### [2] [KeySense: LLM-Powered Hands-Down, Ten-Finger Typing on Commodity Touchscreens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12432)
*Tony Li,Yan Ma,Zhuojun Li,Chun Yu,IV Ramakrishnan,Xiaojun Bi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: KeySense 是一种软件解决方案，通过认知-运动模式提高触摸屏上的十指输入效率与舒适性，且无需额外硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的触摸屏软件键盘限制用户手部放松，迫使其使用慢且耗力的单指点击。

Method: KeySense 通过认知-运动时间模式隔离意图点击和静指噪声，使用精细调优的 LLM 解码器将结果转换为预期的词。

Result: 在受控组件测试中，解码器的表现显著优于两个统计基线；参与者研究显示 KeySense 在身体负担和打字速度上均优于传统的悬停式键盘。

Conclusion: KeySense 能够在普通触摸屏上实现准确、高效且舒适的十指输入，无需额外硬件。

Abstract: Existing touchscreen software keyboards prevent users from resting their hands, forcing slow and fatiguing index-finger tapping ("chicken typing") instead of familiar hands-down ten-finger typing. We present KeySense, a purely software solution that preserves physical keyboard motor skills. KeySense isolates intentional taps from resting-finger noise using cognitive-motor timing patterns, and then uses a fine-tuned LLM decoder to convert the resulting noisy letter sequence into the intended word. In controlled component tests, the decoder substantially outperforms two statistical baselines (top-1 accuracy 84.8% vs 75.7% and 79.3%). A 12-participant study shows clear ergonomic and performance benefits: compared with the conventional hover-style keyboard, users rated KeySense as markedly less physically demanding (NASA-TLX median 1.5 vs 4.0), and after brief practice typed significantly faster (WPM 28.3 vs 26.2, p < 0.01). These results indicate that KeySense enables accurate, efficient, and comfortable ten-finger text entry on commodity touchscreens without any extra hardware.

### [3] [GatheringSense: AI-Generated Imagery and Embodied Experiences for Understanding Literati Gatherings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12565)
*You Zhou,Bingyuan Wang,Hongcheng Guo,Rui Cao,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI生成内容与身体参与在文人雅集文化理解中的结合，发现两者互补能增强参与者对文化的理解和感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在中国传统文化中的文人雅集这一主题尚未深入研究，同时现有的文化应用仍无法有效传达文化仪式和社会框架的深层意义。

Method: 通过一项混合方法研究(N=48)，比较AI生成的多模态内容与身体参与如何相辅相成，支持对文人雅集的理解。

Result: 该研究展示了AI生成的内容与实现文化理解的身体参与相结合如何增强对文人雅集的理解和文化共鸣，提出了一种双路径框架并通过GatheringSense进行实例化。

Conclusion: AI生成的内容在提升文化符号的可读性和情感吸引力方面有效，但在身体一致性和微观可信度方面存在局限，而身体体验显著加深了参与者对仪式规则和社会角色的理解。

Abstract: Chinese literati gatherings (Wenren Yaji), as a situated form of Chinese traditional culture, remain underexplored in depth. Although generative AI supports powerful multimodal generation, current cultural applications largely emphasize aesthetic reproduction and struggle to convey the deeper meanings of cultural rituals and social frameworks. Based on embodied cognition, we propose an AI-driven dual-path framework for cultural understanding, which we instantiate through GatheringSense, a literati-gathering experience. We conduct a mixed-methods study (N=48) to compare how AI-generated multimodal content and embodied participation complement each other in supporting the understanding of literati gatherings and fostering cultural resonance. Our results show that AI-generated content effectively improves the readability of cultural symbols and initial emotional attraction, yet limitations in physical coherence and micro-level credibility may affect users' satisfaction. In contrast, embodied experience significantly deepens participants' understanding of ritual rules and social roles, and increases their psychological closeness and presence. Based on these findings, we offer empirical evidence and five transferable design implications for generative experience in cultural heritage.

### [4] [Editable XAI: Toward Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment with Co-Editable Explanations of Interpretable Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12569)
*Haoyang Chen,Jingwen Bai,Fang Tian,Brian Y Lim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究提出CoExplain工具，通过可编辑的XAI增强用户对AI决策的理解和控制，改善了用户体验和模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进XAI的可编辑性，解决由于领域知识不匹配导致的用户与AI之间的理解不一致问题。

Method: 开发了CoExplain工具，利用神经网络和符号规则，实现主动学习效果，用户能够编辑规则以改善XAI的解释能力。

Result: 用户研究显示，CoExplain及可手动编辑的XAI相比只读XAI提高了用户理解和模型对齐，且使用更简单，编辑次数和时间更少。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的可编辑XAI显著提高了用户理解和模型对齐，增强了控制感。

Abstract: While Explainable AI (XAI) helps users understand AI decisions, misalignment in domain knowledge can lead to disagreement. This inconsistency hinders understanding, and because explanations are often read-only, users lack the control to improve alignment. We propose making XAI editable, allowing users to write rules to improve control and gain deeper understanding through the generation effect of active learning. We developed CoExplain, leveraging a neural network for universal representation and symbolic rules for intuitive reasoning on interpretable attributes. CoExplain explains the neural network with a faithful proxy decision tree, parses user-written rules as an equivalent neural network graph, and collaboratively optimizes the decision tree. In a user study (N=43), CoExplain and manually editable XAI improved user understanding and model alignment compared to read-only XAI. CoExplain was easier to use with fewer edits and less time. This work contributes Editable XAI for bidirectional AI alignment, improving understanding and control.

### [5] [Bonik Somiti: A Social-market Tool for Safe, Accountable, and Harmonious Informal E-Market Ecosystem in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12650)
*ATM Mizanur Rahman,Sharifa Sultana*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了非正式电子市场中的诈骗和争端管理问题，并提出了一个名为Bonik Somiti的解决方案来支持更安全和更可追责的交易环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们在非正式电子市场中面临着诈骗和经济损失的问题，现有的信息共享方式难以有效解决这些问题。

Method: 通过对124名参与者的调查和对36名买家、卖家及相关利益相关者的访谈进行研究，评估了Bonik Somiti的效果。

Result: 在31名参与者的评估中，识别了管理诈骗、解决争端以及在现有非正式实践中建立信任的多种挑战。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Bonik Somiti，一个社会技术系统，旨在通过结构化报告和管理员调解来增强非正式电子市场的安全性和可追责性。

Abstract: People in informal e-markets often try to deal with fraud and financial harm by sharing posts, screenshots, and warnings in social media groups. However, buyers and sellers frequently face further problems because these reports are scattered, hard to verify, and rarely lead to resolution. We studied these issues through a survey with 124 participants and interviews with 36 buyers, sellers, and related stakeholders from Bangladesh and designed Bonik Somiti, a socio-technical system that supports structured reporting, admin-led mediation, and accountability in informal e-markets. Our evaluation with 32 participants revealed several challenges in managing fraud, resolving disputes, and building trust within existing informal practices and the assumptions behind them. Based on these findings, we further discuss how community-centered technologies can be designed to support safer and more accountable informal e-markets in the Global South.

### [6] [From Guidelines to Practice: Evaluating the Reproducibility of Methods in Computational Social Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12747)
*Fakhri Momeni,Sarah Sajid,Johannes Kiesel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究评估了可重复性障碍，发现规范化文档和执行环境可显著提高可重复性，并探讨了计算社会科学中的相关设计和基础设施影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算社会科学中的可重复性仍然是一个中心挑战，复杂的工作流程、不断变化的软件生态系统和不一致的文档限制了研究者重新执行已发布方法的能力。

Method: 通过47次可用性测试会话，结合行为性能指标（成功率、任务时间和错误概况）、问卷数据和主题分析，系统评估了可重复性。

Result: 经过规范化的文档显著减少了存储库级别的错误，提高了用户对方法输出的解释能力，标准化执行环境进一步改善了可重复性，取得了最高的成功率和最短的任务完成时间。

Conclusion: 可重复性障碍是多层次的，需要在文档质量、环境稳定性和概念清晰度方面进行协调改进。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in computational social science, where complex workflows, evolving software ecosystems, and inconsistent documentation hinder researchers ability to re-execute published methods. This study presents a systematic evaluation of reproducibility across three conditions: uncurated documentation, curated documentation, and curated documentation paired with a preset execution environment. Using 47 usability test sessions, we combine behavioral performance indicators (success rates, task time, and error profiles) with questionnaire data and thematic analysis to identify technical and conceptual barriers to reproducibility.
  Curated documentation substantially reduced repository-level errors and improved users ability to interpret method outputs. Standardizing the execution environment further improved reproducibility, yielding the highest success rate and shortest task completion times. Across conditions, participants frequently relied on AI tools for troubleshooting, often enabling independent resolution of issues without facilitator intervention.
  Our findings demonstrate that reproducibility barriers are multi-layered and require coordinated improvements in documentation quality, environment stability, and conceptual clarity. We discuss implications for the design of reproducibility platforms and infrastructure in computational social science.

### [7] [SoK: Understanding the Pedagogical, Health, Ethical, and Privacy Challenges of Extended Reality in Early Childhood Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12749)
*Supriya Khadka,Sanchari Das*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究系统化分析了111项关于XR在学前教育中的应用的研究，发现AR技术占主导，指出了技术和隐私等方面的挑战，并提炼出一个促进儿童健康发展的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨XR技术在三至八岁儿童早期教育中的应用潜力与风险，特别关注技术、教育、健康、隐私及公平等方面的挑战。

Method: 进行知识系统化（SoK）研究，量化分析了111项同行评审的研究，通过建立风险与关注矩阵以及增强人类发展模型，识别XR应用中的各种问题。

Result: 发现AR技术主要使用于平板电脑和手机，而VR技术应用较少；量化了不同方面的学术关注度，结果表明教育方法受到最多关注，而数据访问实践则被忽视。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个以儿童为中心的XR研发路线图，以帮助HCI研究者和教育者超越新奇设计，构建符合儿童发展需求、安全且可供多元学习者使用的系统。

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) combines dense sensing, real-time rendering, and close-range interaction, making its use in early childhood education both promising and high risk. To investigate this, we conduct a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) of 111 peer-reviewed studies with children aged 3-8, quantifying how technical, pedagogical, health, privacy, and equity challenges arise in practice. We found that AR dominates the landscape (73%), focusing primarily on tablets or phones, while VR remains uncommon and typically relies on head mounted displays (HMDs). We integrate these quantitative patterns into a joint risk and attention matrix and an Augmented Human Development (AHD) model that link XR pipeline properties to cognitive load, sensory conflict, and access inequity. Finally, implementing a seven dimension coding scheme on a 0 - 2 scale, we obtain mean scholarly attention scores of 1.56 for pedagogy, 1.04 for privacy (primarily procedural consent), 0.96 for technical reliability, 0.92 for accessibility in low resource contexts, 0.81 for medical and health issues, 0.52 for accessibility for disabilities, and 0.14 for data security practices. This indicates that pedagogy receives the most systematic scrutiny, while data access practices is largely overlooked. We conclude by offering a roadmap for Child-Centered XR that helps HCI researchers and educators move beyond novelty to design systems that are developmentally aligned, secure by default, and accessible to diverse learners.

### [8] ["Not Human, Funnier": How Machine Identity Shapes Humor Perception in Online AI Stand-up Comedy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12763)
*Xuehan Huang,Canwen Wang,Yifei Hao,Daijin Yang,Ray LC*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了AI的身份在幽默生成中的潜力，发现机器身份的代理在网络表演中被认为更搞笑，显示出人机系统设计的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI是否能够利用其独特身份来增强幽默生成，特别是在喜剧领域。

Method: 通过设计一个基于机器身份的代理并进行人类观众的研究（N=32），分析这种代理在幽默生成中的表现。

Result: 研究表明，机器身份的代理在幽默表现上比传统的基准GPT代理更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 机器身份的代理在网络表演中被认为比基准GPT代理更有趣，这表明AI的身份可以增强幽默生成。

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly applied to domains previously reserved for human actors. One such domain is comedy, whereby both the general public working with ChatGPT and research-based LLM-systems have tried their hands on making humor. In formative interviews with professional comedians and video analyses of stand-up comedy in humans, we found that human performers often use their ethnic, gender, community, and demographic-based identity to enable joke-making. This suggests whether the identity of AI itself can empower AI humor generation for human audiences. We designed a machine-identity-based agent that uses its own status as AI to tell jokes in online performance format. Studies with human audiences (N=32) showed that machine-identity-based agents were seen as funnier than baseline-GPT agent. This work suggests the design of human-AI integrated systems that explicitly utilize AI as its own unique identity apart from humans.

### [9] [Social, Spatial, and Self-Presence as Predictors of Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction in Social Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12764)
*Qijia Chen,Andrea Bellucci,Giulio Jacucci*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨社交和自我存在感如何影响虚拟现实中的基本心理需求，结果显示性别和年龄对这些关系有调节作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨虚拟现实中存在感与基本心理需求之间的关系，填补理论与实证研究的空白。

Method: 通过对301名社交VR用户的调查，采用结构方程模型进行分析。

Result: 社交存在感预测所有三种基本需求，自我存在感仅预测能力和关系，而空间存在感未显示直接或调节效果。

Conclusion: 存在感作为一种动机机制，受到人口统计学因素的影响，对设计支持需求的虚拟现实环境有重要启示。

Abstract: Extensive research has examined presence and basic psychological needs (drawing on Self-Determination Theory) in digital media. While prior work offers hints of potential connections, we lack a systematic account of whether and how distinct presence dimensions map onto the basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We surveyed 301 social VR users and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. Results show that social presence predicts all three needs, while self-presence predicts competence and relatedness, and spatial presence shows no direct or moderating effects. Gender and age moderated these relationships: women benefited more from social presence for autonomy and relatedness, men from self- and spatial presence for competence and autonomy, and younger users showed stronger associations between social presence and relatedness, and between self-presence and autonomy. These findings position presence as a motivational mechanism shaped by demographic factors. The results offer theoretical insights and practical implications for designing inclusive, need-supportive multiuser VR environments.

### [10] [The Configuration of Space: Probing the Way Social Interaction and Perception are Affected by Task-Specific Spatial Representations in Online Video Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12771)
*Yihuan Chen,Kexue Fu,Qianyi Chen,Zhicong Lu,Ray LC*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了空间配置对2D视频聊天中的沟通能力和社交感知的影响，发现房间格式提升了群体注意力和自我意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线沟通的普及，探索人类在2D屏幕上互动时，空间配置如何影响交流能力、社交感知及行为。

Method: 比较正常的画廊界面和基于场景的房间界面

Result: 在社交支持任务中，参与者对整个群体分配注意力，在房间格式中表现出明显的自我意识；在话题讨论中，参与者利用空间参照来定位其忠诚度。

Conclusion: 空间配置对在线沟通中的心理需求有重要影响，应在协作通信系统的设计中加以考虑。

Abstract: Humans live and act in 3D space, but often work and communicate on 2D surfaces. The prevalence of online communication on 2D screens raises the issue of whether human spatial configuration affects our capabilities, social perception, and behaviors when interacting with others in 2D video chat. How do factors like location, setting, and context subtly shape our online communication, particularly in scenarios such as social support and topic-based discussions? Using Ohyay.co as a platform, we compared a normal gallery interface with a scene-based Room-type interface where participants are located in circular arrangement on screen in a social support task, and found that participants allocated attention to the group as a whole, and had pronounced self-awareness in the Room format. We then chose a two-sided topic for discussion in the Gallery interface and the Room interface where participants on each team face-off against each other, and found that they utilized spatial references to orient their allegiances, expressing greater engagement with those farther away in digital space and greater empathy with those closer, in the Room over the Gallery format. We found spatial effects in the way participants hide from the spotlight, in perspective-taking, and in their use of expressive gestures in time on the screen. This work highlights the need for considering spatial configuration in 2D in the design of collaborative communication systems to optimize for psychological needs for particular tasks.

### [11] [Usage Matters: The Role of Frequency, Duration, and Experience in Presence Formation in Social Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12775)
*Qijia Chen,Andrea Bellucci,Giulio Jacucci*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 使用频率和时长提升社交VR的存在感，且均在不同年龄和性别中表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索日常使用行为如何影响社交VR中的存在感，填补现有研究中的空白。

Method: 对295名用户进行调查，评估整体、社交、空间和自我存在感，使用有效性测量工具。

Result: 使用频率和时长与各种维度的存在感呈正相关，频繁和延长的会议会增强“在场”体验。

Conclusion: 使用强度是社交VR中存在感的重要预测因素，研究结果对开发包容性的社交VR环境具有指导意义。

Abstract: The sense of presence is central to immersive experiences in Virtual Reality (VR), and particularly salient in socially rich platforms like social VR. While prior studies have explored various aspects related to presence, less is known about how ongoing usage behaviors shape presence in everyday engagement. To address this gap, we examine whether usage intensity, captured through frequency of use, session duration, and years of VR experience, predicts presence in social VR. A survey of 295 users assessed overall, social, spatial, and self-presence using validated scales. Results show that both frequency and duration consistently predict higher presence across all dimensions, with interaction effects indicating that frequent and extended sessions synergistically amplify the experience of "being there." These effects were stable across age and gender. Our findings extend presence research beyond the laboratory by identifying behavioral predictors in social VR and offer insights for building inclusive environments that reliably foster presence.

### [12] [iRULER: Intelligible Rubric-Based User-Defined LLM Evaluation for Revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12779)
*Jingwen Bai,Wei Soon Cheong,Philippe Muller,Brian Y Lim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出iRULER工具，以改善大型语言模型在写作评估中的反馈质量，使其更具可操作性和针对性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型给出的反馈往往难以理解且不够具体，因此需要一种能够提供明确标准和可操作建议的工具。

Method: 使用基于结构化标准的iRULER工具，通过实验进行写作修订和评估创建。

Result: iRULER在控制实验中表现出了最佳的写作修订评分并获得用户的高度认可。

Conclusion: iRULER显著提高了写作修订评分，并被认为比传统的评估工具更有帮助和一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable for evaluating writing. However, text feedback they provide is often unintelligible, generic, and not specific to user criteria. Inspired by structured rubrics in education and intelligible AI explanations, we propose iRULER following identified design guidelines to \textit{scaffold} the review process by \textit{specific} criteria, providing \textit{justification} for score selection, and offering \textit{actionable} revisions to target different quality levels. To \textit{qualify} user-defined criteria, we recursively used iRULER with a rubric-of-rubrics to iteratively \textit{refine} rubrics. In controlled experiments on writing revision and rubric creation, iRULER most improved validated LLM-judged review scores and was perceived as most helpful and aligned compared to read-only rubric and text-based LLM feedback. Qualitative findings further support how iRULER satisfies the design guidelines for user-defined feedback. This work contributes interactive rubric tools for intelligible LLM-based review and revision of writing, and user-defined rubric creation.

### [13] [Media Framing Moderates Risk-Benefit Perceptions and Value Tradeoffs in Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12785)
*Philipp Brauner,Felix Glawe,Luisa Vervier,Martina Ziefle*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了信息框架如何影响公众对工业人机协作的风险和利益的评估，发现信息框架在认知整合中起着重要作用，负面框架下风险和利益之间存在较强的相互影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究工业人机协作（HRC）的公众接受度受到员工对风险和利益的感知影响。

Method: 通过随机分配1150名参与者阅读不同框架的报纸文章（正面或负面）来考察信息框架对感知风险和利益对价值评估影响的调节作用。

Result: 信息框架影响风险、利益和价值的绝对评估。正面框架下仅观察到主要效应，负面框架则呈现更强的主要效应和显著的负交互效应，表明高风险感知会削弱利益的正面影响。

Conclusion: 信息框架影响HRC的绝对评估，并且在风险和利益的权衡中呈现不同的认知整合方式。负面框架产生更强但相互依赖的效应，而正面框架支持加法评估，因此在未来HRC研究中需考虑信息框架的作用。

Abstract: Public acceptance of industrial human-robot collaboration (HRC) is shaped by how risks and benefits are perceived by affected employees. Positive or negative media framing may shape and shift how individuals evaluate HRC. This study examines how message framing moderates the effects of perceived risks and perceived benefits on overall attributed value. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 1150) were randomly assigned to read either a positively or negatively framed newspaper article in one of three industrial contexts (autonomy, employment, safety) about HRC in production. Subsequently, perceived risks, benefits, and value were measured using reliable and publicly available psychometric scales. Two multiple regressions (one per framing condition) tested for main and interaction effects. Framing influenced absolute evaluations of risk, benefits, and value. In both frames, risks and benefits significantly predicted attributed value. Under positive framing, only main effects were observed (risks: beta = -0.52; benefits: beta = 0.45). Under negative framing, both predictors had stronger main effects (risks: beta = -0.69; benefits: beta = 0.63) along with a significant negative interaction (beta = -0.32), indicating that higher perceived risk diminishes the positive effect of perceived benefits. Model fit was higher for the positive frame (R^2 = 0.715) than for the negative frame (R^2 = 0.583), indicating greater explained variance in value attributions. Framing shapes the absolute evaluation of HRC and how risks and benefits are cognitively integrated in trade-offs. Negative framing produces stronger but interdependent effects, whereas positive framing supports additive evaluations. These findings highlight the role of strategic communication in fostering acceptance of HRC and underscore the need to consider framing in future HRC research.

*Stephan Vonschallen,Dominique Oberle,Theresa Schmiedel,Friederike Eyssel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成社交机器人在高等教育中的责任和效能，提出了设计要求以确保其可靠表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成社交机器人在个性化辅导中的风险和挑战，特别是信息需求，以促进其在教育领域的有效和道德使用。

Method: 通过对12名大学生和讲师的半结构化访谈，识别出与自我知识、用户知识和上下文知识相关的设计要求。

Result: 确定了12项设计要求，涵盖自我知识、用户知识和上下文知识的各个方面。

Conclusion: 本研究为辅导类生成社交机器人的设计提供了结构化基础，帮助其在满足教育和伦理期望的同时，增强能力。

Abstract: Generative social robots (GSRs) powered by large language models enable adaptive, conversational tutoring but also introduce risks such as hallucina-tions, overreliance, and privacy violations. Existing frameworks for educa-tional technologies and responsible AI primarily define desired behaviors, yet they rarely specify the knowledge prerequisites that enable generative systems to express these behaviors reliably. To address this gap, we adopt a knowledge-based design perspective and investigate what information tutor-ing-oriented GSRs require to function responsibly and effectively in higher education. Based on twelve semi-structured interviews with university stu-dents and lecturers, we identify twelve design requirements across three knowledge types: self-knowledge (assertive, conscientious and friendly per-sonality with customizable role), user-knowledge (personalized information about student learning goals, learning progress, motivation type, emotional state and background), and context-knowledge (learning materials, educa-tional strategies, course-related information, and physical learning environ-ment). By identifying these knowledge requirements, this work provides a structured foundation for the design of tutoring GSRs and future evaluations, aligning generative system capabilities with pedagogical and ethical expecta-tions.

*Prabhav Bhatnagar,Jianheng He,Shamit Ahmed,Andrés Lucero,Perttu Hämäläinen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 为了填补游戏设计研究中工具不足的空白，本文提出了RDA，一个开源工具，可以在游戏测试时进行反思和数据收集，三个研究者在不同游戏项目中评估了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏设计过程、工件和文化的研究兴趣日益增长，但支持这些研究的工具和流程尚不充分，尤其是在捕捉设计决策和项目演变方面。

Method: 通过在三种不同的游戏开发项目中进行实践，研究人员基于自传体设计的原则评估RDA工具。

Result: RDA工具能够在游戏设计中的测试时刻收集细粒度的反思并自动记录测试结果，体现设计决策的具体化过程。

Conclusion: RDA工具能够有效地支持游戏设计过程中的反思和数据收集，但在实施中也面临一定的挑战。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in researching game design processes, artifacts and culture through active game design. Tools and processes to support these attempts are limited, especially in terms of a) capturing smaller design decisions where rich tacit information is often situated, and b) visually tracking the project's growth and evolution. To address this gap, we present Reflection at Design Actualization (RDA), an open source tool and process for collecting granular reflections at playtesting moments and automatically recording the playtests, bringing reflection and data collection closer to the point where design decisions concretize. Three researchers engaged with and evaluated RDA in three varied game development projects, adhering to the principles of autobiographical design. We illustrate the designer experience with RDA through three themes, namely, designer-routine compromise, designer-researcher persona consolidation, and mirror effect of RDA. We further discuss the tool's challenges and share each designer's personal experience as case studies.

Motivation: 本研究旨在比较基于超声形状补全和基于锥束计算机断层扫描（CBCT）的两种增强现实（AR）引导成像工作流程，以评估成像模式对用户性能、可用性和信任的影响。

Method: 将两种成像系统集成到增强现实框架中，能够现场可视化和轨迹引导。超声基础的工作流程结合了AR引导的机器人扫描、概率形状补全和AR可视化。CBCT基础的工作流程使用AR辅助的扫描体积规划、CBCT采集和AR可视化。进行了分组用户研究，评估两个阶段：（1）规划和图像采集，和（2）针插入。

Result: 规划时间在CBCT基础的工作流程中显著较短，而在两种模式下SUS、SEQ和NASA-TLX相比亦相近。在针插入阶段，CBCT基础的工作流程实现了略快的插入时间、更低的放置错误和更高的主观信任评分。超声基础的工作流程在关节插入上实现了适当的准确性，但对腰椎穿刺的错误较大，因为重建更依赖于形状补全。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，两种增强现实（AR）引导的成像工作流程都适用于脊柱干预支持。CBCT基础的AR在插针时在效率、准确性、可用性和用户信任方面具有优势，而超声基础的AR提供适应性和无辐射成像，但在较深的脊柱区域受到形状补全的限制。这些互补特性促使了混合AR引导的动力，结合CBCT提供全局解剖背景和规划，辅以超声进行适应性术中更新。

Abstract: Purpose: This study compares two augmented reality (AR)-guided imaging workflows, one based on ultrasound shape completion and the other on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), for planning and executing lumbar needle interventions. The aim is to assess how imaging modality influences user performance, usability, and trust during AR-assisted spinal procedures.
  Methods: Both imaging systems were integrated into an AR framework, enabling in situ visualization and trajectory guidance. The ultrasound-based workflow combined AR-guided robotic scanning, probabilistic shape completion, and AR visualization. The CBCT-based workflow used AR-assisted scan volume planning, CBCT acquisition, and AR visualization. A between-subject user study was conducted and evaluated in two phases: (1) planning and image acquisition, and (2) needle insertion.
  Results: Planning time was significantly shorter with the CBCT-based workflow, while SUS, SEQ, and NASA-TLX were comparable between modalities. In the needle insertion phase, the CBCT-based workflow yielded marginally faster insertion times, lower placement error, and better subjective ratings with higher Trust. The ultrasound-based workflow achieved adequate accuracy for facet joint insertion, but showed larger errors for lumbar puncture, where reconstructions depended more heavily on shape completion.
  Conclusion: The findings indicate that both AR-guided imaging pipelines are viable for spinal intervention support. CBCT-based AR offers advantages in efficiency, precision, usability, and user confidence during insertion, whereas ultrasound-based AR provides adaptive, radiation-free imaging but is limited by shape completion in deeper spinal regions. These complementary characteristics motivate hybrid AR guidance that uses CBCT for global anatomical context and planning, augmented by ultrasound for adaptive intraoperative updates.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了生成社交代理在物理治疗中通过知识配置对说服性的影响，结果显示知识的可用性显著增强了其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成社交代理在说服用户达成个人目标（如健康生活方式）方面的潜力，同时考察其潜在的操控和欺骗风险。

Method: 通过对ChatGPT生成的对话脚本进行定性分析，并对第三方观察者的评分进行比较，研究其在物理治疗中的说服效果。

Result: 研究发现，基于大型语言模型的GSA能够适应果断和表现性格特征，从而显著提升说服力。年龄和过去职业的信息对说服力有积极影响，而物理治疗相关的知识未显著影响说服力。

Conclusion: 生成社交代理（GSA）通过对可用知识的访问来调节其行为，从而提高说服性的表现。

Abstract: Generative Social Agents (GSAs) are increasingly impacting human users through persuasive means. On the one hand, they might motivate users to pursue personal goals, such as healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, they are associated with potential risks like manipulation and deception, which are induced by limited control over probabilistic agent outputs. However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness. Contextual knowledge about physiotherapy benefits did not significantly impact persuasiveness, possibly because the LLM had inherent knowledge about such benefits even without explicit prompting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of empirically studying behavioral patterns of GSAs, specifically in terms of what information generative AI systems require for consistent and responsible communication.

Result: 通过实验验证，Human Tool提高了任务表现，降低了人类工作负载，实现了更平衡的协作动态。

Conclusion: 强调以人为中心的AI设计，MCP样式的工具增强了AI领导能力，同时放大了人类独特的优势。

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration faces growing challenges as AI systems increasingly outperform humans on complex tasks, while humans remain responsible for orchestration, validation, and decision oversight. To address this imbalance, we introduce Human Tool, an MCP-style interface abstraction, building on recent Model Context Protocol designs, that exposes humans as callable tools within AI-led, proactive workflows. Here, "tool" denotes a coordination abstraction, not a reduction of human authority or responsibility. Building on LLM-based agent architectures, we operationalize Human Tool by modeling human contributions through structured tool schemas of capabilities, information, and authority. These schemas enable agents to dynamically invoke human input based on relative strengths and reintegrate it through efficient, natural interaction protocols. We validate the framework through controlled studies in both decision-making and creative tasks, demonstrating improved task performance, reduced human workload, and more balanced collaboration dynamics compared to baseline systems. Finally, we discuss implications for human-centered AI design, highlighting how MCP-style human tools enable strong AI leadership while amplifying uniquely human strengths.

Motivation: 小型社区农场在促进经济和社会文化方面的重要性，但面临教育和基础设施的挑战。

Method: 通过对11位来自小型民族社区的农民进行半结构化访谈，研究社会资本如何促进知识交流。

Result: 发现亲密的家庭和社区联系在促进信息记录和代际知识传递中起到关键作用，并能帮助农民接入更广泛的资源与网络。

Conclusion: 应设计支持现有支持系统的技术，并考虑社区的文化价值、独特实践和代际关系。

Abstract: Farming plays a significant role in the economy by supporting related industries such as food, retail, and local services. Community-based small farms, while offering unique social and cultural benefits, face persistent challenges, including limited access to formal education and underdeveloped infrastructure, which have been discussed in prior research. This study focuses on community-driven factors, such as workarounds for recording critical information and practices for passing down farming knowledge across generations. Through 11 semi-structured interviews with farmers from a small ethnic community, the Hmong, we explore how bonding social capital, rooted in close family and community ties, supports informal knowledge exchange and creates pathways to bridging and linking capital. These relationships help farmers connect to broader networks, resources, and institutions. Our findings highlight opportunities for designing technologies that support and strengthen existing support systems. We discuss how technologies should be designed to reflect the cultural values, unique practices, and intergenerational relationships embedded in community-based farms.

TL;DR: AutoOptimization是一个多目标优化框架，通过用户的语言偏好进行UI适配，结合Pareto前沿搜索和多个代理的推理能力，提供了一种自动化的UI布局优化解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户界面设计的复杂性增加，如何有效地根据用户偏好进行适应和优化成为了一项挑战。

Method: 采用基于用户语言偏好的Pareto前沿搜索方法，同时整合多个代理以解析用户需求、配置优化问题并验证结果。

Result: 提出了一个新的多目标优化框架AutoOptimization，用于适应用户界面。该框架基于用户的语言偏好，引导候选布局的优先级Pareto前沿搜索，选择适合的目标函数并根据用户指示对其进行参数化，从而定义优化问题。然后，求解器生成一系列最优的用户界面布局，并将其与用户指令进行验证，以适应最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了以前对布局的手动检查和使用人口平均值作为目标参数的需求，通过多个代理的顺序集成，使系统能够利用它们的推理能力来解释用户偏好，配置优化问题，并验证优化结果。

Abstract: We present AutoOptimization, a novel multi-objective optimization framework for adapting user interfaces. From a user's verbal preferences for changing a UI, our framework guides a prioritization-based Pareto frontier search over candidate layouts. It selects suitable objective functions for UI placement while simultaneously parameterizing them according to the user's instructions to define the optimization problem. A solver then generates a series of optimal UI layouts, which our framework validates against the user's instructions to adapt the UI with the final solution. Our approach thus overcomes the previous need for manual inspection of layouts and the use of population averages for objective parameters. We integrate multiple agents sequentially within our framework, enabling the system to leverage their reasoning capabilities to interpret user preferences, configure the optimization problem, and validate optimization outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在使用生成模型时面临控制困难和指令模糊的问题，现有工具过于依赖人类努力，而优化方法未能满足人类中心的生成任务需求。

Method: 引入APPO算法，用户只需提供二元偏好反馈，无需迭代提示，APPO在利用用户反馈与探索新方向之间自适应平衡。

Result: 在图像生成的评估中，APPO在较少迭代下取得了令人满意的结果，且认知负担低于手动编辑提示。

Conclusion: APPO将促进人类与人工智能在生成任务中的协作，利用用户偏好指导复杂内容创作。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly powerful, yet users struggle to guide them through prompts. The generative process is difficult to control and unpredictable, and user instructions may be ambiguous or under-specified. Prior prompt refinement tools heavily rely on human effort, while prompt optimization methods focus on numerical functions and are not designed for human-centered generative tasks, where feedback is better expressed as binary preferences and demands convergence within few iterations. We present APPO, a preference-guided prompt optimization algorithm. Instead of iterating prompts, users only provide binary preferential feedback. APPO adaptively balances its strategies between exploiting user feedback and exploring new directions, yielding effective and efficient optimization. We evaluate APPO on image generation, and the results show APPO enables achieving satisfactory outcomes in fewer iterations with lower cognitive load than manual prompt editing. We anticipate APPO will advance human-AI collaboration in generative tasks by leveraging user preferences to guide complex content creation.

Motivation: 在HCI和可视化领域，协同设计越来越受欢迎，但在可视化环境中有效应用该方法的指导仍然很少。

Method: 通过与当地艺术社区进行为期两年半的协同设计项目，组织了一系列协同设计会议，旨在促进社区对艺术资金分配的探索和理解。

Result: 在这些迭代的会议中，我们建立了共同的理解，并开发了针对社区需求的可视化原型。同时发现协同设计的实践总是反复回到过程的“模糊前端”。

Abstract: Co-design is an increasingly popular approach in HCI and visualization, yet there is little guidance on how to effectively apply this method in visualization contexts. In this paper, we visually present our experience of a two-and-a-half-year co-design project with the local arts community. Focusing on facilitating community exploration and sense-making around arts funding distribution, the project involved a series of co-design sessions between visualization researchers and members of the arts community. Through these iterative sessions, we built shared understanding and developed visualization prototypes tailored to community needs. However, the practice is far from complete, and we found ourselves continually returning to the "fuzzy front end" of the co-design process. We share this ongoing story through comic-style visuals and reflect on three fuzzy front ends that we encountered during the project. By sharing these experiences with the visualization community, we hope to offer insights that others can draw on in their own community-engaged co-design work.

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在构建开放词汇机器人感知系统时的高维VLM嵌入提炼问题，LatentAM提供了一个灵活且效率高的在线映射解决方案。

Method: 在线字典学习方法结合3D Gaussian Splatting，利用流式RGB-D观测构建可扩展的潜在特征地图。

Result: 与传统高维VLM嵌入提炼方法不同，LatentAM实现了模型无关和无预训练的字典学习，支持不同VLM的集成。

Conclusion: 在公共基准和大规模自定义数据集上的实验表明，LatentAM在特征重建保真度上显著优于最先进的方法，同时在评估数据集上实现接近实时的速度（12-35 FPS）。

Abstract: We present LatentAM, an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping framework that builds scalable latent feature maps from streaming RGB-D observations for open-vocabulary robotic perception. Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage. Experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale custom dataset demonstrate that LatentAM attains significantly better feature reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving near-real-time speed (12-35 FPS) on the evaluated datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界环境中，将高层次语言指令转化为具体可执行动作是一个极具挑战性的任务，因此需要一个更高效的规划策略。

Method: 设计了一种高效的视觉预见规划（ForeAct）模型，结合预想的未来观察与子任务描述，操作性强且实时。

Result: 在基准测试中，我们的框架在11个任务上达到87.4%的成功率，相比基线提升了40.9%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在11个多样化、多个步骤的真实世界任务中取得了87.4%的平均成功率，显著提升了视觉语言行动模型的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models convert high-level language instructions into concrete, executable actions, a task that is especially challenging in open-world environments. We present Visual Foresight Planning (ForeAct), a general and efficient planner that guides a VLA step-by-step using imagined future observations and subtask descriptions. With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA. Importantly, state-of-the-art VLAs can integrate our planner seamlessly by simply augmenting their visual inputs, without any architectural modification. The foresight generator is pretrained on over 1 million multi-task, cross-embodiment episodes, enabling it to learn robust embodied dynamics. We evaluate our framework on a benchmark that consists of 11 diverse, multi-step real-world tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 87.4%, demonstrating a +40.9% absolute improvement over the $π_0$ baseline (46.5%) and a +30.3% absolute improvement over $π_0$ augmented with textual subtask guidance (57.1%).

TL;DR: Schur-MI通过预计算和Schur补因子化显著降低了MI计算的成本，同时在实际应用中实现了显著的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息（MI）作为机器人信息获取的一个原则性和广泛使用的目标，其高计算成本限制了在实时规划中的应用。

Method: 提出了Schur-MI，这是一种高斯过程MI公式，利用RIG的迭代结构预计算并重用昂贵的中间量，并使用Schur补因子化以避免大行列式计算。

Result: 实验表明，Schur-MI相较于标准MI公式，在现实世界的水深数据集上实现了高达12.7倍的加速。

Conclusion: 通过使MI计算适用于在线规划，Schur-MI帮助弥合信息理论目标与实时机器人探索之间的差距。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a principled and widely used objective for robotic information gathering (RIG), providing strong theoretical guarantees for sensor placement (SP) and informative path planning (IPP). However, its high computational cost, dominated by repeated log-determinant evaluations, has limited its use in real-time planning. This letter presents Schur-MI, a Gaussian process (GP) MI formulation that (i) leverages the iterative structure of RIG to precompute and reuse expensive intermediate quantities across planning steps, and (ii) uses a Schur-complement factorization to avoid large determinant computations. Together, these methods reduce the per-evaluation cost of MI from $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{A}|^3)$, where $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denote the candidate and selected sensing locations, respectively. Experiments on real-world bathymetry datasets show that Schur-MI achieves up to a $12.7\times$ speedup over the standard MI formulation. Field trials with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) performing adaptive IPP further validate its practicality. By making MI computation tractable for online planning, Schur-MI helps bridge the gap between information-theoretic objectives and real-time robotic exploration.

Motivation: 提出一种新的多回合RL框架，以处理长时间导航决策过程，通过多回合对话形式促进模型学习。

Method: 开发了LongNav-R1，一个端到端的多回合强化学习框架，用于长时间导航的VLA模型优化。

Result: 在对象导航基准上，LongNav-R1通过4,000个轨迹将Qwen3-VL-2B成功率从64.3%提高到73.0%。

Conclusion: LongNav-R1 demonstrates better sample efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-horizon navigation tasks while showing robustness in real-world settings.

Abstract: This paper develops LongNav-R1, an end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to optimize Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models for long-horizon navigation. Unlike existing single-turn paradigm, LongNav-R1 reformulates the navigation decision process as a continuous multi-turn conversation between the VLA policy and the embodied environment. This multi-turn RL framework offers two distinct advantages: i) it enables the agent to reason about the causal effects of historical interactions and sequential future outcomes; and ii) it allows the model to learn directly from online interactions, fostering diverse trajectory generation and avoiding the behavioral rigidity often imposed by human demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Horizon-Adaptive Policy Optimization. This mechanism explicitly accounts for varying horizon lengths during advantage estimation, facilitating accurate temporal credit assignment over extended sequences. Consequently, the agent develops diverse navigation behaviors and resists collapse during long-horizon tasks. Experiments on object navigation benchmarks validate the framework's efficacy: With 4,000 rollout trajectories, LongNav-R1 boosts the Qwen3-VL-2B success rate from 64.3% to 73.0%. These results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. The model's generalizability and robustness are further validated by its zero-shot performance in long-horizon real-world navigation settings. All source code will be open-sourced upon publication.

Motivation: 在真实场景中，传感器经常受到有限视野的限制，因此需要有效推断环境信息，以确保安全和精准操作。

Method: 使用深度学习模型处理有限FOV的时间序列传感器数据，采用单幅图像格式表示动态信息。

Result: 我们证明了可以使用多种现有图像到图像的学习模型，准确预测地图状态。

Conclusion: 通过将动态传感器数据以单幅图像格式表示，结合深度学习，我们能够在多种传感场景中高准确度地预测地图状态。

Abstract: When autonomous systems are deployed in real-world scenarios, sensors are often subject to limited field-of-view (FOV) constraints, either naturally through system design, or through unexpected occlusions or sensor failures. In conditions where a large FOV is unavailable, it is important to be able to infer information about the environment and predict the state of nearby surroundings based on available data to maintain safe and accurate operation. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of deep learning for dynamic map state prediction based on limited FOV time series data. We show that by representing dynamic sensor data in a simple single-image format that captures both spatial and temporal information, we can effectively use a wide variety of existing image-to-image learning models to predict map states with high accuracy in a diverse set of sensing scenarios.

Motivation: 随着自主移动机器人在复杂环境中的应用不断扩大，了解和预测其在面对机械损伤后的行为变得至关重要。

Method: 通过自监督学习，使用自然语言描述机械损伤，并在高保真模拟环境中，构建适应不同损伤类型的肢体动力学模型。

Result: 提出了一种名为ZLIK的方法，利用自监督学习结合自然语言描述来量化和预测机械损伤对自主移动机器人肢体动力学的影响。该模型在高保真的物理模拟器BeamNG.tech上收集了多种受损车辆的数据，显示出良好的适应性和普适性。

Conclusion: ZLIK方法成功实现了对不同损伤的零样本适应，并显著降低了肢体动力学误差，使得移动机器人在不同情境下的性能提升。

Abstract: High-performance autonomous mobile robots endure significant mechanical stress during in-the-wild operations, e.g., driving at high speeds or over rugged terrain. Although these platforms are engineered to withstand such conditions, mechanical degradation is inevitable. Structural damage manifests as consistent and notable changes in kinodynamic behavior compared to a healthy vehicle. Given the heterogeneous nature of structural failures, quantifying various damages to inform kinodynamics is challenging. We posit that natural language can describe and thus capture this variety of damages. Therefore, we propose Zero-shot Language Informed Kinodynamics (ZLIK), which employs self-supervised learning to ground semantic information of damage descriptions in kinodynamic behaviors to learn a forward kinodynamics model in a data-driven manner. Using the high-fidelity soft-body physics simulator BeamNG.tech, we collect data from a variety of structurally compromised vehicles. Our learned model achieves zero-shot adaptation to different damages with up to 81% reduction in kinodynamics error and generalizes across the sim-to-real and full-to-1/10$^{\text{th}}$ scale gaps.

Motivation: 在构建可靠和可信的机器人系统时，故障推理至关重要，但以往方法通常依赖于封闭集分类问题或大量人类标注，难以处理真实世界中微妙和组合性的故障。

Method: ARMOR框架提出了一种多任务自我精炼的过程，模型通过对过去输出的条件反应来迭代预测故障检测结果和自然语言推理，同时结合稀疏二元标签和丰富推理注释进行训练。

Conclusion: ARMOR在故障检测和推理上达到了最先进的表现，显著优于先前的方法，展现出对异构监督和开放式推理的强大鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reasoning about failures is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy robotic systems. Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于控制障碍函数（CBF）的安全过滤器，通过音频信息增强自主移动机器人在动态建设环境中的安全性和导航能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于控制障碍函数的安全过滤器，该过滤器结合了一种实时轻量级的电锤探测器，通过调节障碍函数来实现导航中的安全保障。

Conclusion: 音频感知的集成为自主机器人在动态和安全关键环境中提供了更丰富的多模态安全推理路径。

Abstract: Construction automation increasingly requires autonomous mobile robots, yet robust autonomy remains challenging on construction sites. These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous satellite servicing missions must execute close-range rendezvous under stringent safety and operational constraints while remaining computationally tractable for onboard use and robust to uncertainty in sensing, actuation, and dynamics. This paper presents CORTEX (Convex Optimization for Rendezvous Trajectory Execution), an autonomous, perception-enabled, real-time trajectory design and guidance framework for close-range rendezvous. CORTEX integrates a deep-learning perception pipeline with convex-optimisation-based trajectory design and guidance, including reference regeneration and abort-to-safe-orbit logic to recover from large deviations caused by sensor faults and engine failures.
  CORTEX is validated in high-fidelity software simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The software pipeline (Basilisk) models high-fidelity relative dynamics, realistic thruster execution, perception, and attitude control. Hardware testing uses (i) an optical navigation testbed to assess perception-to-estimation performance and (ii) a planar air-bearing testbed to evaluate the end-to-end guidance loop under representative actuation and subsystem effects. A Monte-Carlo campaign in simulation includes initial-state uncertainty, thrust-magnitude errors, and missed-thrust events; under the strongest case investigated, CORTEX achieves terminal docking errors of $36.85 \pm 44.46$ mm in relative position and $1.25 \pm 2.26$ mm/s in relative velocity. On the planar air-bearing testbed, 18 cases are executed (10 nominal; 8 off-nominal requiring recomputation and/or abort due to simulated engine failure and sensor malfunctions), yielding terminal errors of $8.09 \pm 5.29$ mm in position and $2.23 \pm 1.72$ mm/s in velocity.

Conclusion: 所提出的分区高斯过程结合梯度信息实现了更高的精确度，并显著减少了计算时间，适用于复杂和不稳定环境下的实时气动预测和控制算法。

Abstract: We present a quadrotor dynamics Gaussian Process (GP) with gradient information that achieves real-time inference via state-space partitioning and approximation, and that includes aerodynamic effects using data from mid-fidelity potential flow simulations. While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time. This framework provides an efficient foundation for real-time aerodynamic prediction and control algorithms in complex and unsteady environments.

Conclusion: 提供了基于价值函数水平集的正式障碍回避保证，并通过数值仿真显示相较于PPO基线的优势。

Abstract: As autonomous robots move into complex, dynamic real-world environments, they must learn to navigate safely in real time, yet anticipating all possible behaviors is infeasible. We propose a composable, model-free reinforcement learning method that learns a value function and an optimal policy for each individual environment element (e.g., goal or obstacle) and composes them online to achieve goal reaching and collision avoidance. Assuming unknown nonlinear dynamics that evolve in continuous time and are input-affine, we derive a continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function and show that the corresponding advantage function is quadratic in the action and optimal policy. Based on this structure, we introduce a model-free actor-critic algorithm that learns policies and value functions for static or moving obstacles using gradient descent. We then compose multiple reach/avoid models via a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), yielding formal obstacle-avoidance guarantees in terms of value-function level sets, providing a model-free alternative to CLF/CBF-based controllers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance over a PPO baseline applied to a discrete-time approximation.

Motivation: 机器人需要在非静态环境中进行有效规划，因此需要互动感知的三维表示，超越静态几何占用。

Method: 使用单一的单目RGB图像预测神经触觉场，并将其整合进现有的路径规划器中。

Result: 我们的方法在体积三维重建和表面重建上分别提高了85.8%和26.7%，相比于最先进的单目三维重建方法（LRM和Direct3D）。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的神经触觉场显著提升了机器人在复杂环境中的路径规划能力，尤其在动态和变形环境中。

Abstract: Robots operating in the real world must plan through environments that deform, yield, and reconfigure under contact, requiring interaction-aware 3D representations that extend beyond static geometric occupancy. To address this, we introduce neural tactile fields, a novel 3D representation that maps spatial locations to the expected tactile response upon contact. Our model predicts these neural tactile fields from a single monocular RGB image -- the first method to do so. When integrated with off-the-shelf path planners, neural tactile fields enable robots to generate paths that avoid high-resistance objects while deliberately routing through low-resistance regions (e.g. foliage), rather than treating all occupied space as equally impassable. Empirically, our learning framework improves volumetric 3D reconstruction by $85.8\%$ and surface reconstruction by $26.7\%$ compared to state-of-the-art monocular 3D reconstruction methods (LRM and Direct3D).

Motivation: 传统的视觉-语言-动作模型在执行复杂的接触丰富操控任务时存在挑战，主要由于高熵视图和语言输入与低熵但关键的力信号之间的不平衡。

Method: CRAFT框架结合变分信息瓶颈模块，通过培养模型在早期训练中优先关注力量信号，并逐步恢复对多模态信息的访问，以支持力量感知学习。

Conclusion: CRAFT框架显著提升了接触丰富的操作任务的成功率，并能有效地在多种VLA架构中进行调整与通用化。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown a strong capability in enabling robots to execute general instructions, yet they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks, where success requires precise alignment, stable contact maintenance, and effective handling of deformable objects. A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that CRAFT consistently improves task success, generalizes to unseen objects and novel task variations, and adapts effectively across diverse VLA architectures, enabling robust and generalizable contact-rich manipulation.

Conclusion: 我们的研究提出了一种新颖的跟踪方法Eva-Tracker，它显著提高了跟踪的可靠性和计算效率。

Abstract: The Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) is widely used in visibility evaluation to prevent occlusions and collisions during tracking. However, frequent ESDF updates introduce considerable computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose Eva-Tracker, a visibility-aware trajectory planning framework for aerial tracking that eliminates ESDF updates and incorporates a recovery-capable path generation method for target reacquisition. First, we design a target trajectory prediction method and a visibility-aware initial path generation algorithm that maintain an appropriate observation distance, avoid occlusions, and enable rapid replanning to reacquire the target when it is lost. Then, we propose the Field of View ESDF (FoV-ESDF), a precomputed ESDF tailored to the tracker's field of view, enabling rapid visibility evaluation without requiring updates. Finally, we optimize the trajectory using differentiable FoV-ESDF-based objectives to ensure continuous visibility throughout the tracking process. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust tracking results with lower computational effort than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的方法可实现对已嵌入毫米波模块的有效现场表征，为实际应用中的电磁验证提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Characterizing the angular radiation behavior of installed millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar modules is increasingly important in practical sensing platforms, where packaging, mounting hardware, and nearby structures can significantly alter the effective emission profile. However, once a device is embedded in its host environment, conventional chamber- and turntable-based antenna measurements are often impractical. This paper presents a hemispherical angular received-power mapping methodology for in-situ EM validation of installed mmWave modules under realistic deployment constraints. The approach samples the accessible half-space around a stationary device-under-test by placing a calibrated receiving probe at prescribed (phi, theta, r) locations using geometry-consistent positioning and quasi-static acquisition. Amplitude-only received-power is recorded using standard RF instrumentation to generate hemispherical angular power maps that capture installation-dependent radiation characteristics. Proof-of-concept measurements on a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate repeatable hemi-spherical mapping with angular trends in good agreement with full-wave simulation, supporting practical on-site characterization of embedded mmWave transmitters.

Abstract: This paper presents PISHYAR, a socially intelligent smart cane designed by our group to combine socially aware navigation with multimodal human-AI interaction to support both physical mobility and interactive assistance. The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.

Method: 增强模拟-真实联合训练框架（RL-Co）

Result: 在四个真实桌面操作任务中进行评估，使用OpenVLA和π_{0.5}架构观察到相对于仅使用真实数据的微调和基于SFT的联合训练有显著提升：OpenVLA提高了24%的成功率，π_{0.5}提高了20%。

Conclusion: RL联合训练不仅提升了成功率，还增强了对于未见任务变体的泛化能力，提高了真实数据的使用效率，为模拟在真实机器人部署中的应用提供了实用且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \underline{\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \underline{\textit{Co}}-training \modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $π_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $π_{0.5}$. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically valid 3D scenes from single-view observations is a prerequisite for bridging the gap between visual perception and robotic control. However, in scenarios requiring precise contact reasoning, such as robotic manipulation in highly cluttered environments, geometric fidelity alone is insufficient. Standard perception pipelines often neglect physical constraints, resulting in invalid states, e.g., floating objects or severe inter-penetration, rendering downstream simulation unreliable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel physics-constrained Real-to-Sim pipeline that reconstructs physically consistent 3D scenes from single-view RGB-D data. Central to our approach is a differentiable optimization pipeline that explicitly models spatial dependencies via a contact graph, jointly refining object poses and physical properties through differentiable rigid-body simulation. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our reconstructed scenes achieve high physical fidelity and faithfully replicate real-world contact dynamics, enabling stable and reliable contact-rich manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven reinforcement learning and motion tracking have substantially improved humanoid locomotion, yet critical practical challenges remain. In particular, while low-level motion tracking and trajectory-following controllers are mature, whole-body reference-guided methods are difficult to adapt to higher-level command interfaces and diverse task contexts: they require large, high-quality datasets, are brittle across speed and pose regimes, and are sensitive to robot-specific calibration. To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with High-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer. Together, these results establish a practical, experimentally validated pathway toward natural and deployable humanoid control.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Xiaomi-Robotics-0, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model optimized for high performance and fast and smooth real-time execution. The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

Motivation: 探讨如何让机器人在无地图的情况下利用导航标志进行导航。

Method: 提出了一种名为SignScene的标志中心空间-语义表示方法，用于将标志的语义与相应的场景元素和导航动作进行映射。

Result: 在九种不同环境类型的114个查询数据集上评估，达到了88%的标志映射准确率，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过这种方法，机器人能够仅依赖标志实现真实环境中的无地图导航。

Abstract: Navigational signs enable humans to navigate unfamiliar environments without maps. This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that it enables real-world mapless navigation on a Spot robot using only signs.

Abstract: We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

Conclusion: 所提约束六参数联合调谐策略在水下车辆导航中的深度控制具有有效性和工程意义。

Abstract: Depth control of underwater vehicles in engineering applications must simultaneously satisfy requirements for rapid tracking, low overshoot, and actuator constraints. Traditional fuzzy PID tuning often relies on empirical methods, making it difficult to achieve a stable and reproducible equilibrium solution between performance enhancement and control cost. This paper proposes a constrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for tuning six-parameter fuzzy PID controllers. By adjusting the benchmark PID parameters alongside the fuzzy controller's input quantization factor and output proportional gain, it achieves synergistic optimization of the overall tuning strength and dynamic response characteristics of the fuzzy PID system. To ensure engineering feasibility of the optimization results, a time-weighted absolute error integral, adjustment time, relative overshoot control energy, and saturation occupancy rate are introduced. Control energy constraints are applied to construct a constraint-driven comprehensive evaluation system, suppressing pseudo-improvements achieved solely by increasing control inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that, while maintaining consistent control energy and saturation levels, the proposed method significantly enhances deep tracking performance: the time-weighted absolute error integral decreases from 0.2631 to 0.1473, the settling time shortens from 2.301 s to 1.613 s, and the relative overshoot reduces from 0.1494 to 0.01839. Control energy varied from 7980 to 7935, satisfying the energy constraint, while saturation occupancy decreased from 0.004 to 0.003. These results validate the effectiveness and engineering significance of the proposed constrained six-parameter joint tuning strategy for depth control in underwater vehicle navigation scenarios.

Method: 提出了两阶段训练框架和三个深度强化学习管道，包括TRANS-Loco、TRANS-Nav和TRANS。

Result: TRANS展现了在不平坦和社交互动环境中的四足动物导航能力。

Conclusion: TRANS在复杂且动态的人居环境中实现了高效的四足导航。

Abstract: This study introduces TRANS: Terrain-aware Reinforcement learning for Agile Navigation under Social interactions, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quadrupedal social navigation over unstructured terrains. Conventional quadrupedal navigation typically separates motion planning from locomotion control, neglecting whole-body constraints and terrain awareness. On the other hand, end-to-end methods are more integrated but require high-frequency sensing, which is often noisy and computationally costly. In addition, most existing approaches assume static environments, limiting their use in human-populated settings. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage training framework with three DRL pipelines. (1) TRANS-Loco employs an asymmetric actor-critic (AC) model for quadrupedal locomotion, enabling traversal of uneven terrains without explicit terrain or contact observations. (2) TRANS-Nav applies a symmetric AC framework for social navigation, directly mapping transformed LiDAR data to ego-agent actions under differential-drive kinematics. (3) A unified pipeline, TRANS, integrates TRANS-Loco and TRANS-Nav, supporting terrain-aware quadrupedal navigation in uneven and socially interactive environments. Comprehensive benchmarks against locomotion and social navigation baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of TRANS. Hardware experiments further confirm its potential for sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: Real2Gen展示了在不同任务上有效利用单次人类演示进行机器人训练的潜力，并提供了开放的数据和代码。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a popular paradigm to teach robots new tasks, but collecting robot demonstrations through teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching is tedious and time-consuming. In contrast, directly demonstrating a task using our human embodiment is much easier and data is available in abundance, yet transfer to the robot can be non-trivial. In this work, we propose Real2Gen to train a manipulation policy from a single human demonstration. Real2Gen extracts required information from the demonstration and transfers it to a simulation environment, where a programmable expert agent can demonstrate the task arbitrarily many times, generating an unlimited amount of data to train a flow matching policy. We evaluate Real2Gen on human demonstrations from three different real-world tasks and compare it to a recent baseline. Real2Gen shows an average increase in the success rate of 26.6% and better generalization of the trained policy due to the abundance and diversity of training data. We further deploy our purely simulation-trained policy zero-shot in the real world. We make the data, code, and trained models publicly available at real2gen.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: The emerging integration of robots into everyday life brings several major challenges. Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation. SafeFlowMPC achieves strong performance in three real-world experiments on a KUKA 7-DoF manipulator, namely two grasping experiment and a dynamic human-robot object handover experiment.

Abstract: The success of surveillance applications involving small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) depends on how long the limited on-board power would persist. To cope with this challenge, alternative renewable sources of lift are sought. One promising solution is to extract energy from rising masses of buoyant air. This paper proposes a local-global behavioral management and decision-making approach for the autonomous deployment of soaring-capable UAVs. The cooperative UAVs are modeled as non-deterministic finite state-based rational agents. In addition to a mission planning module for assigning tasks and issuing dynamic navigation waypoints for a new path planning scheme, in which the concepts of visibility and prediction are applied to avoid the collisions. Moreover, a delayed learning and tuning strategy is employed optimize the gains of the path tracking controller. Rigorous comparative analyses carried out with three benchmarking baselines and 15 evolutionary algorithms highlight the adequacy of the proposed approach for maintaining the surveillance persistency (staying aloft for longer periods without landing) and maximizing the detection of targets (two times better than non-cooperative and semi-cooperative approaches) with less power consumption (almost 6% of battery consumed in six hours).

Abstract: Distinguishing the feel of smooth silk from coarse cotton is a trivial everyday task for humans. When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions. To show that this audio-visual tactile sensing approach generalizes beyond the training data, we learn general representations of fabric stretchiness, thickness, and roughness.

TL;DR: INHerit-SG redefines maps in robot navigation to better align with human intent using structured knowledge bases, enhancing interpretability and efficiency in complex query handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for better alignment between environmental mapping and human intent in robotic navigation tasks, addressing limitations of existing semantic scene graph approaches that struggle with interpretability and real-time reasoning.

Method: INHerit-SG employs a structured knowledge base with natural-language anchors, an asynchronous architecture for efficient graph management, and utilizes Large Language Models for logical processing and reasoning.

Result: INHerit-SG is a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base designed for robot navigation. It enhances semantic scene graphs by introducing natural-language descriptions as semantic anchors, improving alignment with human intent. The architecture features an asynchronous dual-process for efficient graph updates and robust reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance in complex environments.

Conclusion: INHerit-SG offers a significant advancement in aligning semantic scene graphs with human intent in robotic navigation, demonstrating high performance in understanding and executing complex retrieval queries.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in foundation models, semantic scene graphs have emerged as a prominent paradigm for high-level 3D environmental abstraction in robot navigation. However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

Motivation: 研究传统的分块执行方式在进行视觉语言动作建模时，存在的不连续性问题以及 RTC 方法的局限性。

Method: 提出了 Legato 方法，该方法结合调度形状的已知行动与噪声，在训练时对动作流进行去噪，并通过每步指导确保训练与推理的一致性。

Result: Legato 方法在执行过程中显著减少了多模态切换和犹豫现象，导致任务完成时间缩短，结果显示在五个操作任务中均比 RTC 改善了约 10%。

Conclusion: Legato 对于提升 VLA 模型的执行流畅性和减少多模态切换具有显著帮助，确保了模型在实际应用中的高效性。

Abstract: Action chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.

Conclusion: 特征集和相似性度量的相互作用使得某些组合能够更好地区分类似的行为，此外，提出了一种基于自组织映射的方法来识别特征空间中行为不易区分的区域。

Abstract: Collective behaviours often need to be expressed through numerical features, e.g., for classification or imitation learning. This problem is often addressed by proposing an ad-hoc feature set for a particular swarm behaviour context, usually without further consideration of the solution's resilience outside of the conceived context. Yet, the development of automatic methods to design swarm behaviours is dependent on the ability to measure quantitatively the similarity of swarm behaviours. Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours. We select swarm feature sets and similarity measures from prior swarm robotics works, which mainly considered a narrow behavioural context and assess their robustness. We demonstrate that the interplay of feature set and similarity measure makes some combinations more suitable to distinguish groups of similar behaviours. We also propose a self-organised map-based approach to identify regions of the feature space where behaviours cannot be easily distinguished.

Abstract: Robust closed-loop locomotion remains challenging for soft quadruped robots due to high-dimensional dynamics, actuator hysteresis, and difficult-to-model contact interactions, while conventional proprioception provides limited information about ground contact. In this paper, we present a learning-based control framework for a pneumatically actuated soft quadruped equipped with tactile suction-cup feet, and we validate the approach experimentally on physical hardware. The control policy is trained in simulation through a staged learning process that starts from a reference gait and is progressively refined under randomized environmental conditions. The resulting controller maps proprioceptive and tactile feedback to coordinated pneumatic actuation and suction-cup commands, enabling closed-loop locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces. When deployed on the real robot, the closed-loop policy outperforms an open-loop baseline, increasing forward speed by 41% on a flat surface and by 91% on a 5-degree incline. Ablation studies further demonstrate the role of tactile force estimates and inertial feedback in stabilizing locomotion, with performance improvements of up to 56% compared to configurations without sensory feedback.

Abstract: Recent work leverages the capabilities and commonsense priors of generative models for robot control. In this paper, we present an agentic control system in which a reasoning-capable language model plans and executes tasks by selecting and invoking robot skills within an iterative planner and executor loop. We deploy the system on two physical robot platforms in two settings: (i) tabletop grasping, placement, and box insertion in indoor mobile manipulation (Mobipick) and (ii) autonomous agricultural navigation and sensing (Valdemar). Both settings involve uncertainty, partial observability, sensor noise, and ambiguous natural-language commands. The system exposes structured introspection of its planning and decision process, reacts to exogenous events via explicit event checks, and supports operator interventions that modify or redirect ongoing execution. Across both platforms, our proof-of-concept experiments reveal substantial fragility, including non-deterministic suboptimal behavior, instruction-following errors, and high sensitivity to prompt specification. At the same time, the architecture is flexible: transfer to a different robot and task domain largely required updating the system prompt (domain model, affordances, and action catalogue) and re-binding the same tool interface to the platform-specific skill API.

Conclusion: UniManip能够在无需微调或重新配置的情况下，实现从固定基座到移动操作的直接零-shot转移，展现出其在复杂环境中的强大适应性和执行能力。

Abstract: Achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation requires robots to seamlessly bridge high-level semantic intent with low-level physical interaction in unstructured environments. However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

Abstract: Due to sensor limitations, environments that off-road mobile robots operate in are often only partially observable. As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.

Abstract: Soft robotics has emerged as a versatile field with applications across various domains, from healthcare to industrial automation, and more recently, art and interactive installations. The inherent flexibility, adaptability, and safety of soft robots make them ideal for applications that require delicate, organic, and lifelike movement, allowing for immersive and responsive interactions. This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments. The findings of this study highlight how soft robotics can embody human emotional states, offering a new medium for insightful artistic expression and interaction, and demonstrating how art displays can be embodied.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) can make semantic and visual inferences across diverse settings, providing valuable common-sense priors for robotic control. However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: The ability to learn manipulation skills by watching videos of humans has the potential to unlock a new source of highly scalable data for robot learning. Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.
