We\nintroduce an assessment of LLM alignment with guidelines for ethical\ncommunication, adapted from clinical principles and applied to expressions of\nrisk factors for STB in multi-turn conversations. Using a codebook created and\nvalidated by clinicians, mobilizing the volunteer participation of practicing\ntherapists and trainees (N=43) based in the U.S., and using generalized linear\nmixed-effects models for statistical analysis, we assess a single fully\nopen-source LLM, OLMo-2-32b.

We find that\ncontrary to clinical best practice, OLMo-2-32b, and, possibly by extension,\nother LLMs, will become less likely to invite continued dialog as users send\nmore signals of STB risk in multi-turn settings.

Conventional\ngrippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to\nobjects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that\ncombines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The\ngripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the\ninternal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental\nexperiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a\nproportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables\nthe gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the\ngripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,\nfruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than\napplying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid\ngripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative\nto relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper\nflexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects."}

The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a\npowerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing\nthe stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through\nnoisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive\nparallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been\nchallenging.

In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner\n(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP\nformulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,\nleaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP\nrepresents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors\nand implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this\nrepresentation.

This paper\nproposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify\nevasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index\n(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,\nenabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral\nconflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500\nhigh-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events.
