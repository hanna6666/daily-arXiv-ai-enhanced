Nevertheless, the existing UI optimization models had overlooked the Cross-Responsiveness (CR) assessment, affecting the user interaction efficiency. Consequently, this article proposes a dynamic web UI optimization through CR assessment using Finite Exponential Continuous State Machine (FECSM) and Quokka Nonlinear Difference Swarm Optimization Algorithm (QNDSOA). Initially, the design and user interaction related information is collected as well as pre-processed for min-max normalization. Next, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based features are extracted, followed by user behaviour pattern grouping. Meanwhile, the CR assessment is done using FECSM. Then, the proposed Bidirectional Gated Luong and Mish Recurrent Unit (BiGLMRU) is used to classify the User eXperience (UX) change type, which is labelled based on the User Interface Change Prediction Index (UICPI). Lastly, a novel QNDSOA is utilized to optimize the UI design with an average fitness of 98.5632%. Feedback monitoring is done after optimal deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528FECSM\u548cQNDSOA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651\u8de8\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u6307\u6570\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff08FECSM\uff09\u548cQuokka\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5dee\u5206\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08QNDSOA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.5632%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u76d1\u63a7\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u540e\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u9875\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u8de8\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u3002"}}

There are changes within a session, across sessions, and across individuals. Variations over time for a given individual must be carefully managed to improve the BCI performance, including its accuracy, reliability, and robustness over time. This review paper presents and discusses the causes of non-stationarity in the EEG signal, along with its consequences for BCI applications, including covariate shift.

Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution.

Traditional methods involving heavy equipment are costly and time-consuming. Recent SHM approaches use advanced non-contact sensors, IoT, and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses for faster inspections and immersive experiences during inspections. However, current methods lack quantitative damage data, remote collaboration support, and accurate 3D model alignment with the real structure. Recognizing these current challenges, this paper proposes an AR-based system that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) visualization and follows a flexible manipulation approach of 3D holograms to improve structural condition assessments. The proposed framework utilizes the Vuforia software development toolkit to enable the automatic alignment of 3D models to the real structure, ensuring successful model alignment to assist users in accurately visualizing damage locations. The framework also enables flexible manipulation of damage locations, making it easier for users to identify multiple damage points in the 3D models. The system is validated through lab-scale and full-scale bridge use cases, with data transfer performance analyzed under 4G and 5G conditions for remote collaboration. This study demonstrates that the proposed AR-based SHM framework successfully aligns 3D models with real structures, allowing users to manually adjust models and damage locations. The experimental results confirm its feasibility for remote collaborative inspections, highlighting significant improvements with 5G networks. Nevertheless, performance under 4G remains acceptable, ensuring reliability even without 5G coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u57285G\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b(SHM)\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e(AR)\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5efa\u7b51\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21(BIM)\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u76843D\u5168\u606f\u56fe\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5229\u7528Vuforia\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f503D\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6865\u6881\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e863D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc74G\u548c5G\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5AR-based SHM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f503D\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u635f\u4f24\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u57285G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u67e5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u57284G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5728\u6ca1\u67095G\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Code and data are available at github.com/srl-ethz/sors", "summary": "The deployment of complex soft robots in multiphysics environments requires advanced simulation frameworks that not only capture interactions between different types of material, but also translate accurately to real-world performance. Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u5668SORS\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9ad8\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSORS\uff08Soft Over Rigid Simulator\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u53d7\u9650\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u60ac\u81c2\u504f\u8f6c\u548c\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81c2\u7684\u538b\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy.

Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development.

The system continuously monitors the payload's orientation and computes the required piston height of each robot to maintain the desired orientation of the payload. In this work, we propose an open loop controller coupled with a closed loop PID controller to achieve the goal. As our modelling makes no assumptions on the type of terrain, the system can work on any unknown and uneven terrains and inclinations.

Paralleling this offline model of care, people who seek mental health support from AI chatbots are similarly provided little context for how their expressions of distress are processed by the model, and subsequently, the logic that may underlie model responses. People in severe distress who turn to AI chatbots for support thus find themselves caught between black boxes, with unique forms of agony that arise from these intersecting opacities, including misinterpreting model outputs or attributing greater capabilities to a model than are yet possible, which has led to documented real-world harms. Building on empirical research from clinical psychology and AI safety, alongside rights-oriented frameworks from medical ethics, we describe how the distinct psychological state induced by severe distress can influence chatbot interaction patterns, and argue that this state of mind (combined with differences in how a user might perceive a chatbot compared to a care provider) uniquely necessitates a higher standard of interpretability in comparison to general AI chatbot use. Drawing inspiration from newer interpretable treatment paradigms, we then describe specific technical and interface design approaches that could be used to adapt interpretability strategies from four specific mental health fields (psychotherapy, community-based crisis intervention, psychiatry, and care authorization) to AI models, including consideration of the role of interpretability in the treatment process and tensions that may arise with greater interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u56f0\u6270\u4e0b\uff0cAI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5fc5\u987b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u5bfb\u6c42\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u5bf9\u4e8eAI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u5176\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u4e0e\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u548cAI\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533b\u7597\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6280\u672f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316AI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e00\u822cAI\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u538b\u75db\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness.

Situated at the intersection of media archaeology and speculative design, the project questions dominant narratives of progress by embedding generative AI in an obsolete, tactile interface.

Drawing on concepts such as zombie media, technostalgia, and speculative design, we argue that reappropriating outdated technologies enables new forms of critical engagement. Erika - the AI-enabled typewriter - functions as both interface and interruption, making space for reflection, irony, and cultural memory.

However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001\u53ca\u5b89\u88c5\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u64cd\u7eb5\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5236\u9020\u548c\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08HMPC\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408CMA-ES\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u62df\u6a21\u5757\u62bd\u8c61\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u652f\u817f\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u987b\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u5177\u5907\u5927\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u652f\u817f\u5f62\u6001\u3002"}}

However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA.

Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5730\u9762-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548c\u9884\u88c5\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u53ef\u6355\u83b7\u8ddd\u79bb\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5730\u9762-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u6d4b\u8ddd\u3001\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u7a0b\u548c\u5149\u6d41\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u62ec\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u6d4b\u8ddd\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a0.09\u7c73\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6355\u83b7\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

As a result, the observed geometry is incomplete, and grasp estimation algorithms perform suboptimally. To address this limitation, we leverage diffusion models to perform category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from a single view, reconstructing complete object geometries to provide richer context for grasp planning. Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks. Unlike prior work, which primarily considers isolated objects or minimal clutter, we evaluate shape completion and grasping in realistic clutter scenarios with household objects. In preliminary evaluations on a cluttered scene, our approach consistently results in better grasp success rates than a naive baseline without shape completion by 23% and over a recent state of the art shape completion approach by 19%.

This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8bef\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7406\u89e3 AI \u5931\u8bef\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8bef\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5931\u8bef\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u63a9\u76d6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u8f6e\u591a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u89c2\u5bdf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4ece\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8f6c\u4e3a\u9610\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5f80\u5f80\u6df7\u6dc6\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u8b66\u89c9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI \u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8bef\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u7b80\u5316\u5171\u540c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Experiments on real-world and public datasets demonstrate that Tri-Select improves both selection efficiency and dataset quality, making it well-suited for scalable crowdsensing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa Tri-Select\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f17\u5305\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u4f17\u5305\u611f\u77e5\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "Tri-Select \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Tri-Select \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4f17\u5305\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume.

Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity.

However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale.

We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase.

Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "PolaRiS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5171\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u521b\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PolaRiS\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u626b\u63cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5171\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPolaRiS\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u7b80\u6613\u6027\u4e5f\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "PolaRiS\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}
