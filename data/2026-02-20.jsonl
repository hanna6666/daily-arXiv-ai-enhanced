We applied the ICAP learning theory to design two new types of worked examples, Buggy (students fix bugs), and Guided (students complete missing rules), requiring varying levels of cognitive engagement, and investigated their impact on learning in a controlled experiment with 155 undergraduate students in a logic problem solving tutor. Students in the Buggy and Guided examples groups performed significantly better on the posttest than those receiving passive worked examples. Buggy problems helped high prior knowledge learners whereas Guided problems helped low prior knowledge learners. Behavior analysis showed that Buggy produced more exploration-revision cycles, while Guided led to more help-seeking and fewer errors. This research contributes to the design of interventions in logic problem solving for varied levels of learner knowledge and a novel application of behavior analysis to compare learner interactions with the tutor."}

We address this gap through a randomized controlled trial in a large introductory economics course (N=354), where we introduce and deploy FeedbackWriter - a system that generates AI suggestions to teaching assistants (TAs) while they provide feedback on students' knowledge-intensive essays. TAs have the full capacity to adopt, edit, or dismiss the suggestions. Students were randomly assigned to receive either handwritten feedback from TAs (baseline) or AI-mediated feedback where TAs received suggestions from FeedbackWriter. Students revise their drafts based on the feedback, which is further graded. In total, 1,366 essays were graded using the system. We found that students receiving AI-mediated feedback produced significantly higher-quality revisions, with gains increasing as TAs adopted more AI suggestions. TAs found the AI suggestions useful for spotting gaps and clarifying rubrics."}

Designing traces to have an informative, but not overwhelming, level of detail remains a critical challenge. In three user studies on a Computer User Agent, we investigate the utility of basic action traces for verification, explore three alternatives via design probes, and test a novel interface's impact on error finding in question-answering tasks. As expected, we find that current practices are cumbersome, limiting their efficacy. Conversely, our proposed design reduced the time participants spent finding errors. However, although participants reported higher levels of confidence in their decisions, their final accuracy was not meaningfully improved. To this end, our study surfaces challenges for human verification of agentic systems, including managing built-in assumptions, users' subjective and changing correctness criteria, and the shortcomings, yet importance, of communicating the agent's process."}

Evolving alongside digital technologies, the severity and scale of violence have grown consistently, leading to widespread public concern. In this paper, we present four eras of image-based DSV in South Korea, spanning from the early internet era of the 1990s to the deepfake scandals in the mid-2020s. Drawing from media coverage, legal documents, and academic literature, we elucidate forms and characteristics of DSV cases in each era, tracing how entrenched misogyny is reconfigured and amplified through evolving technologies, alongside shifting legislative measures. Taking a genealogical approach to read prominent cases of different eras, our analysis identifies three constitutive and interconnected dimensions of DSV: (1) the homo-social fabrication of \"obscenity\", wherein victims' imagery becomes collectively framed as obscene through participatory practices in male-dominant networks; (2) the increasing imperceptibility of violence, as technologies foreclose victims' ability to perceive harm; and (3) the commercialization of abuse through decentralized economic infrastructures. We suggest future directions for CSCW research, and further reflect on the value of the genealogical method in enabling non-linear understanding of DSV as dynamically evolving sociotechnical configurations of harm."}

The proposed method applies the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to point clouds measured from the upper region of the pallet and thereby tracks the relative position and attitude angle difference between the pallet and the fork during the unloading operation in real-time. According to the tracking result, the fork is aligned parallel to the target surface. After the fork is aligned, it is possible to complete the unloading process by withdrawing the fork along the tilt, preventing any dragging of the pallet. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through dynamic simulations and experiments using a real forklift that replicate unloading operations onto the inclined bed of a truck."}

While digital interventions promise personalization, many remain one-size-fits-all and fail to reflect parents' lived practices. We present CalmReminder, a watch-based system that detects children's calm moments and delivers just-in-time prompts to parents. Through a four-week deployment with 16 families (twelve completed) of children with ADHD, we compared notification strategies ranging from hourly to random to only when the child was inferred to be calm. Our sensing-based notifications were frequently perceived as arriving during calm moments. More importantly, parents adopted the system in diverse ways: using notifications for praise, mindfulness, activity planning, or conversation. These findings show that parents are not passive recipients but active designers, reshaping interventions to fit their parenting styles. We contribute a calm detection pipeline, empirical insights into families' flexible appropriation of notifications, and design implications for intervention systems that foster agency."}

The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods."}

When combined with Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a temporal logic widely used for formalizing interpretable robotic tasks, these methods can address complex spatiotemporal constraints. However, traditional approaches rely on min-max robustness measures that focus only on critical time points and subformulae, creating non-smooth optimization landscapes with sharp decision boundaries that hinder efficient tree exploration.\n  We propose RRT$^η$, a sampling-based planning framework that integrates the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM) robustness measure to evaluate satisfaction across all time points and subformulae.

Our framework synthesizes dynamically feasible control sequences satisfying STL specifications with high robustness while maintaining the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of RRT$^\\ast$. We validate our approach on three robotic systems. A double integrator point robot, a unicycle mobile robot, and a 7-DOF robot arm, demonstrating superior performance over traditional STL robustness-based planners in multi-constraint scenarios with limited guidance signals."}

User control can be helpful when system responses are misaligned with their goals and contexts, a gap that becomes especially consequential for blind users that may rely on these systems for access. We invite 11 blind users to customize their interactions with a real-world conversational VQA system. Drawing on 418 interactions, reflections, and post-study interviews, we analyze prompting-based techniques participants adopted, including those introduced in the study and those developed independently in real-world settings. VQA interactions were often lengthy: participants averaged 3 turns, sometimes up to 21, with input text typically tenfold shorter than the responses they heard. Built on state-of-the-art LLMs, the system lacked verbosity controls, was limited in estimating distance in space and time, relied on inaccessible image framing, and offered little to no camera guidance. We discuss how customization techniques such as prompt engineering can help participants work around these limitations. Alongside a new publicly available dataset, we offer insights for interaction design at both query and system levels."}

While HRI research has conducted field studies in public spaces, these are often limited to controlled experiments with prototype robots or structured observational methods, such as the Wizard of Oz technique. However, the autonomous mobile robots we encounter today, particularly delivery robots, operate beyond the control of researchers, navigating dynamic routes and unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, a more deliberate approach is required. Drawing inspiration from public realm ethnography in urban studies, geography, and sociology, this paper proposes the Walk-Along with Robots (WawR) methodology. We outline the key features of this method, the steps we applied in our study, the unique insights it offers, and the ways it can be evaluated.

Thinking ahead explicitly about meeting goals may improve effectiveness, but current collaboration platforms lack integrated support. We tested a lightweight goal-reflection intervention in a preregistered field experiment in a global technology company (361 employees, 7196 meetings). Over two weeks, workers in the treatment group completed brief pre-meeting surveys in their collaboration platform, nudging attention to goals for upcoming meetings. To measure impact, both treatment and control groups completed post-meeting surveys about meeting effectiveness. While the intervention impact on meeting effectiveness was not statistically significant, mixed-methods findings revealed improvements in self-reported awareness and behaviour across both groups, with post-meeting surveys unintentionally functioning as an intervention. We highlight the promise of supporting goal reflection, while noting challenges of evaluating and supporting workplace reflection for meetings, including workflow and collaboration norms, and attitudes and behaviours around meeting preparation.

Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories."}

Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time.

Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI."}

We propose a demonstration segmentation and pooling approach that extracts a series of manipulation graphs and estimates distributions over object states across task phases. In contrast to prior graph-based methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows, our approach captures complete object interactions spanning from the onset of control to the end of the manipulation.

Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots."}

While the CA's composite personality did not affect participants' decisions, it did affect their perceptions and emotional responses. Particularly, participants interacting with pessimistic CAs felt lower emotional state and lower affinity towards the cause, perceived the CA as less trustworthy and less competent, and yet tended to donate more toward the charity.

Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects. This work presents CFM as a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies, offering a scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems."}

While recent LLM-based approaches partially reduce this burden, they struggle to generate effective analysis plans and appropriate insights and visualizations when user intent is abstract. Meanwhile, a vast collection of analysis notebooks produced across platforms and organizations contains rich analytical knowledge that can potentially guide automated EDA. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a natural way to leverage such corpora, but general methods often treat notebooks as static documents and fail to fully exploit their potential knowledge for automating EDA. To address these limitations, we propose NotebookRAG, a method that takes user intent, datasets, and existing notebooks as input to retrieve, enhance, and reuse relevant notebook content for automated EDA generation. For retrieval, we transform code cells into context-enriched executable components, which improve retrieval quality and enable rerun with new data to generate updated visualizations and reliable insights. For generation, an agent leverages enhanced retrieval content to construct effective EDA plans, derive insights, and produce appropriate visualizations. Evidence from a user study with 24 participants confirms the superiority of our method in producing high-quality and intent-aligned EDA notebooks."}

Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant. The framework bridges inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous building block for trajectory design and feasibility checks."}

But, while AI tutors have shown promise in introductory programming courses, no work has evaluated their use in hands-on exploration and exploitation of systems (e.g., ``capture-the-flag'') commonly used to teach cybersecurity. Thus, despite growing interest and need, no work has evaluated how students use AI tutors or whether they benefit from their presence in real, large-scale cybersecurity courses. To answer this, we conducted a semester-long observational study on the use of an embedded AI tutor with 309 students in an upper-division introductory cybersecurity course. By analyzing 142,526 student queries sent to the AI tutor across 396 cybersecurity challenges spanning 9 core cybersecurity topics and an accompanying set of post-semester surveys, we find (1) what queries and conversational strategies students use with AI tutors, (2) how these strategies correlate with challenge completion, and (3) students' perceptions of AI tutors in cybersecurity education. In particular, we identify three broad AI tutor conversational styles among users: Short (bounded, few-turn exchanges), Reactive (repeatedly submitting code and errors), and Proactive (driving problem-solving through targeted inquiry). We also find that the use of these styles significantly predicts challenge completion, and that this effect increases as materials become more advanced. Furthermore, students valued the tutor's availability but reported that it became less useful for harder material. Based on this, we provide suggestions for security educators and developers on practical AI tutor use."}

Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach.

Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models.

This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories.

A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios."}

Here, we present an approach for 3D printed soft optical sensing (SOLen), in which a printed lens is placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. The sensing mechanism relies on deformation-induced lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between the two branches to generate a differential output that encodes both motion direction and amplitude. An acrylate polyurethane resin was modified with lauryl acrylate to improve compliance and optical transmittance, and single-layer optical characterization was used to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance while minimizing DLP layer-related artifacts. The measured refractive index was used in simulations to design a lens profile for a target focal distance, which was then printed with sub-millimeter fidelity. Rotational tests demonstrated reproducible branch-selective signal switching over multiple cycles.

To analyse the complex curvature of an ERA in motion, we design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors. A classifier is trained to map the sensing signals in order to distinguish eight bending states. We validate our model on six held-out trials and compare it against signals' trajectories learned from training runs. Across all tests, the sensing output signals follow the training manifold, and the predicted sequence mirrors real performance and confirms repeatability. Despite deliberate train-test mismatches in actuation speed, the signal trajectories preserve their shape, and classification remains consistently accurate, demonstrating practical voltage- and speed-invariance.

Powered prosthetic knees can partially restore mobility by actively assisting knee joint torque, improving gait symmetry, sit-to-stand transitions, and walking speed. However, added mass from powered components may diminish these benefits, negatively affecting gait mechanics and increasing metabolic cost. Consequently, optimizing mass distribution, rather than simply minimizing total mass, may provide a more effective and practical solution. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement for a powered prosthetic knee in a small cohort. Compared to below-knee placement, the above-knee configuration demonstrated improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed effects on gait symmetry. Kinematic measures indicated similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Additional testing on ramps and stairs confirmed the robustness of the control strategy across multiple locomotion tasks. These preliminary findings suggest that above-knee placement is functionally feasible and that careful mass distribution can preserve the benefits of powered assistance while mitigating adverse effects of added weight. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and guide design and clinical recommendations."}

Integrating environmental semantic awareness enables estimation of potential risks posed by suddenly moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data."}

We present the Intelligent Robotic Imaging System (IRIS), a task-specific 6-DOF manipulator designed for autonomous, learning-driven cinematic motion control. IRIS integrates a lightweight, fully 3D-printed hardware design with a goal-conditioned visuomotor imitation learning framework based on Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT). The system learns object-aware and perceptually smooth camera trajectories directly from human demonstrations, eliminating the need for explicit geometric programming. The complete platform costs under $1,000 USD, supports a 1.5 kg payload, and achieves approximately 1 mm repeatability. Real-world experiments demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, reliable autonomous execution, and generalization across diverse cinematic motions."}

Artificial intelligence and robotics solutions could facilitate their operations, compensating these difficulties. To this end, we propose a dataset for gesture-based UGV control by FRs, introducing a set of 12 commands, drawing inspiration from existing gestures used by FRs and tactical hand signals and refined after incorporating feedback from experienced FRs. Then we proceed with the data collection itself, resulting in 3312 RGBD pairs captured from 2 viewpoints and 7 distances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset especially intended for gesture-based UGV guidance by FRs. Finally we define evaluation protocols for our RGBD dataset, termed FR-GESTURE, and we perform baseline experiments, which are put forward for improvement. We have made data publicly available to promote future research on the domain: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18131333."}

Pangborn"], "title": "Hybrid System Planning using a Mixed-Integer ADMM Heuristic and Hybrid Zonotopes", "comment": null, "summary": "Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to the use of mixed-integer programming, which is computationally intensive and often sensitive to the specific numerical formulation. To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving."}

We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets."}

This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance."}

However, these features may expose users to unwanted privacy risks, including unsolicited data collection and unauthorized data sharing. While security and privacy researchers thus far have explored people's privacy concerns around household robots, literature investigating people's preferred privacy designs and mitigation strategies is still limited. Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time. We synthesize our findings into actionable design recommendations for robot manufacturers and developers."}
