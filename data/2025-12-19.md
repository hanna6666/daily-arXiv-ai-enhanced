Abstract: General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning. Our website is available at https://www.boyuan.space/large-video-planner/.

Conclusion: 该模拟器有效填补了软机器人开发中可扩展性、真实性和易用性之间的空白，成为下一代软机器人原型设计的有效工具。

Abstract: The deployment of complex soft robots in multiphysics environments requires advanced simulation frameworks that not only capture interactions between different types of material, but also translate accurately to real-world performance. Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.

Abstract: Visual inspection of space-borne assets is of increasing interest to spacecraft operators looking to plan maintenance, characterise damage, and extend the life of high-value satellites in orbit. The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类在与机器人互动时如何评估机器人的行为，对开发符合人类期望的社交意识机器人至关重要。

Result: 大型语言模型能够匹配或超过传统监督学习模型的性能，而所需的标记实例数量少了一个数量级，同时通过更多的上下文例子可以改善预测性能。

Conclusion: 通过用户中心的反馈，可以以可扩展的方式改善机器人的行为。

Abstract: Understanding how humans evaluate robot behavior during human-robot interactions is crucial for developing socially aware robots that behave according to human expectations. While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy. This work paves the path to improving robot behavior in a scalable manner through user-centered feedback.

Conclusion: 所提出的控制系统能有效地在未知和不平坦的地形中运输有效载荷，保持载荷的目标方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi robot payload transport system to carry payloads through an environment of unknown and uneven inclinations while maintaining the desired orientation of the payload. For this task, we used custom built robots with a linear actuator (pistons) mounted on top of each robot. The system continuously monitors the payload's orientation and computes the required piston height of each robot to maintain the desired orientation of the payload. In this work, we propose an open loop controller coupled with a closed loop PID controller to achieve the goal. As our modelling makes no assumptions on the type of terrain, the system can work on any unknown and uneven terrains and inclinations. We showcase the efficacy of our proposed controller by testing it on various simulated environments with varied and complex terrains.

TL;DR: SWIFT-Nav是一种基于TD3的无人机导航框架，通过优先级经验重放和模糊安全规则，实现了在杂乱环境中的高效稳定导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效且可靠的无人机导航在杂乱且动态的环境中仍然具有挑战性，因此需要一种新的协调和控制方法。

Method: 采用TD3框架，结合传感器驱动的感知模块和模糊逻辑层，通过优先级经验重放和动态探索策略实现导航。

Conclusion: SWIFT-Nav结合了TD3与回放优先级、校准的探索和模糊安全规则，为复杂场景中的无人机导航提供了一个稳健且可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable UAV navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains challenging. We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness. These results show that combining TD3 with replay prioritisation, calibrated exploration, and fuzzy-safety rules yields a robust and deployable solution for UAV navigation in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Modular manipulators composed of pre-manufactured and interchangeable modules offer high adaptability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.

Conclusion: 提出的仿真平台校准方法显著提高了自动化车辆与背景交通间的交互复制准确性与校准效率，并实现了全自动化的过程。

Abstract: Simulation testing is a fundamental approach for evaluating automated vehicles (AVs). To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal. To address this gap, this study introduces a simulation platform calibration method that ensures high accuracy at both the vehicle and traffic flow levels. The method offers several key features:(1) with the capability of calibration for vehicle-to-vehicle interaction; (2) with accuracy assurance; (3) with enhanced efficiency; (4) with pipeline calibration capability. The proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline with no calibration and a state-of-the-art calibration method. Results show that it enhances the accuracy of interaction replication by 83.53% and boosts calibration efficiency by 76.75%. Furthermore, it maintains accuracy across both vehicle-level and traffic flow-level metrics, with an improvement of 51.9%. Notably, the entire calibration process is fully automated, requiring no human intervention.

### [9] [ManiLong-Shot: Interaction-Aware One-Shot Imitation Learning for Long-Horizon Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16302)
*Zixuan Chen,Chongkai Gao,Lin Shao,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了ManiLong-Shot，一个新的框架，用于有效执行长时间操作任务的单次模仿学习，显示出在多个未知任务中的强大泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单次模仿学习方法主要局限于短期任务，无法有效处理复杂的长时间操控任务，急需改进。

Method: ManiLong-Shot通过围绕物理交互事件构建长时间任务，采用交互意识原语的序列，而不是直接模仿连续轨迹，通过视觉语言模型或基于规则的启发式驱动原理进行预测和计算。

Result: 在模拟实验中，ManiLong-Shot仅用10个短期任务训练，就能一般化到20个未见的长时间任务，实现22.8%的相对提升，并在真实机器人实验中验证了其稳健性。

Conclusion: ManiLong-Shot framework显著提高了OSIL在长时间期操作任务中的执行能力，经过验证表现出色，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: One-shot imitation learning (OSIL) offers a promising way to teach robots new skills without large-scale data collection. However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的地面-空中定位框架，通过整合多种技术，提高飞行机器人的定位稳健性，尤其在视觉传感器退化时仍能保持较高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于固定摄像头和预装标记，导致定位失败和可捕获距离有限，因此寻求一种更全面的解决方案以增强飞行机器人的定位能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境中实现了稳健的在线定位，平均均方根误差约为0.09米，并对捕获丢失和传感器故障具有很好的抗干扰能力。

Abstract: It's a practical approach using the ground-aerial collaborative system to enhance the localization robustness of flying robots in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.

*Enis Yalcin,Joshua O'Hara,Maria Stamatopoulou,Chengxu Zhou,Dimitrios Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: E-SDS combines VLMs with terrain analysis for effective humanoid locomotion training, achieving faster reward design and improved performance in various terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based methods lack perception and the ability to navigate complex terrains in humanoid locomotion tasks.

Method: E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted) framework integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to generate reward functions for humanoid locomotion.

Result: E-SDS enabled successful stair descent in humanoids and reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%, outperforming manual and non-perceptive automated methods.

Conclusion: E-SDS significantly decreases human effort in reward design while enhancing the capability of locomotion policies.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating reward design in humanoid locomotion, which could eliminate the need for tedious manual engineering. However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究通过扩散模型实现了基于单视图的3D形状补全，提高了机器人在杂乱环境中抓取的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉基础的机器人操控中，单个相机视角只能捕捉物体的一侧，且杂乱场景中的遮挡进一步限制了可见性，导致抓取估计算法表现不佳。

Method: 利用扩散模型从单视图获得的部分深度观测中进行类别级3D形状补全，重建完整的物体几何形状，以提供更丰富的上下文用于抓取规划。

Result: 在杂乱场景中的初步评估中，我们的方法在抓取成功率上比没有形状补全的朴素基线高出23%，比最新的形状补全方法高出19%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究实现了对常见家居物品的完整3D形状生成，并在复杂环境中验证了形状补全与抓取的有效性。

Abstract: In vision-based robot manipulation, a single camera view can only capture one side of objects of interest, with additional occlusions in cluttered scenes further restricting visibility. As a result, the observed geometry is incomplete, and grasp estimation algorithms perform suboptimally. To address this limitation, we leverage diffusion models to perform category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from a single view, reconstructing complete object geometries to provide richer context for grasp planning. Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks. Unlike prior work, which primarily considers isolated objects or minimal clutter, we evaluate shape completion and grasping in realistic clutter scenarios with household objects. In preliminary evaluations on a cluttered scene, our approach consistently results in better grasp success rates than a naive baseline without shape completion by 23% and over a recent state of the art shape completion approach by 19%.

Result: 在真实的GeoLife数据集上的实验评估表明，MPBS显著提升了任务完成效率和资源利用。

Conclusion: MPBS显著提高了任务完成效率和资源利用率，提供了一种智能和协作的调度解决方案。

Abstract: As unmanned systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) become increasingly important to applications like urban sensing and emergency response, efficiently recruiting these autonomous devices to perform time-sensitive tasks has become a critical challenge. This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.

Conclusion: Tri-Select 提高了选择效率和数据集质量，适合大规模的众包感知应用。

Abstract: Mobile visual crowdsensing enables large-scale, fine-grained environmental monitoring through the collection of images from distributed mobile devices. However, the resulting data is often redundant and heterogeneous due to overlapping acquisition perspectives, varying resolutions, and diverse user behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Tri-Select, a multi-stage visual data selection framework that efficiently filters redundant and low-quality images. Tri-Select operates in three stages: (1) metadata-based filtering to discard irrelevant samples; (2) spatial similarity-based spectral clustering to organize candidate images; and (3) a visual-feature-guided selection based on maximum independent set search to retain high-quality, representative images. Experiments on real-world and public datasets demonstrate that Tri-Select improves both selection efficiency and dataset quality, making it well-suited for scalable crowdsensing applications.

Abstract: Animated characters often move in non-physical ways and have proportions that are far from a typical walking robot. This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds. We validate the efficacy of our modeling in simulation and on hardware, demonstrating an unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character.

Conclusion: VERM方法在3D动作规划和精细操作中表现出色，显著提高了训练和推理速度。

Abstract: When performing 3D manipulation tasks, robots have to execute action planning based on perceptions from multiple fixed cameras. The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数VLM仅在第三人称数据上训练，这造成了人形机器人的视角不匹配，因此需要有效利用大规模的人类自我中心视频数据。

Method: 提出了一种Egocentric2Embodiment翻译管道，将第一人称视频转化为多层次的schema驱动的VQA监督，并构建了E2E-3M数据集。

Result: PhysBrain在EgoThink规划中展现了显著提升的自我中心理解，且在SimplerEnv环境中成功率达53.9%。

Conclusion: PhysBrain通过在人类自我中心监督数据上的有效传输，显著改善了机器人的自我中心理解和控制能力。

Abstract: Robotic generalization relies on physical intelligence: the ability to reason about state changes, contact-rich interactions, and long-horizon planning under egocentric perception and action. However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.

Abstract: Long-horizon manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in the robotics community. We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase. More results and videos available in https://reinforcegen.github.io/

Conclusion: PolaRiS为下一代机器人基础模型的分布式和民主化评估迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.

Abstract: User Interface (UI) optimization is essential in the digital era to enhance user satisfaction in web environments. Nevertheless, the existing UI optimization models had overlooked the Cross-Responsiveness (CR) assessment, affecting the user interaction efficiency. Consequently, this article proposes a dynamic web UI optimization through CR assessment using Finite Exponential Continuous State Machine (FECSM) and Quokka Nonlinear Difference Swarm Optimization Algorithm (QNDSOA). Initially, the design and user interaction related information is collected as well as pre-processed for min-max normalization. Next, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based features are extracted, followed by user behaviour pattern grouping. Meanwhile, the CR assessment is done using FECSM. Then, the proposed Bidirectional Gated Luong and Mish Recurrent Unit (BiGLMRU) is used to classify the User eXperience (UX) change type, which is labelled based on the User Interface Change Prediction Index (UICPI). Lastly, a novel QNDSOA is utilized to optimize the UI design with an average fitness of 98.5632%. Feedback monitoring is done after optimal deployment.

Abstract: A wide variety of simple sensors, e.g. for temperature, light, or humidity, is finding its way into smart homes. There are special features to consider with regard to the data collected by these sensors: a) the nature of the measured data as "thin but big data" that needs to be contextualized and interpreted, b) which both algorithms and humans are capable of doing (resulting in comprehensive information in the context of the home, including the recognition of activities, behavior, and health of the residents), and c) uses that lead to interesting positive applications, but also to misuse and implications for privacy. When managing such data, it is necessary to take these special features into account, for which the principles of user experience, human-data interaction, and data protection should be considered together. We present our research tool "Sensorkit" and the participatory research approach used with it to collect sensor data in real homes. In our findings, we present identified challenges and explain how we address them through a) meaningful default settings, b) opportunities for users to interact and intervene, and c) life-cycle management of the data. Important aspects include phases before, during, and after the collection, processing, and use of the sensor data, as well as the provision of user-friendly tools and user involvement. Our findings inform beyond the scope of a research project also the development and use of commercial smart home devices and services.

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals suffer from multiple obstacles to reach a wide adoption in clinical settings for communication or rehabilitation. Among these challenges, the non-stationarity of the EEG signal is a key problem as it leads to various changes in the signal. There are changes within a session, across sessions, and across individuals. Variations over time for a given individual must be carefully managed to improve the BCI performance, including its accuracy, reliability, and robustness over time. This review paper presents and discusses the causes of non-stationarity in the EEG signal, along with its consequences for BCI applications, including covariate shift. The paper reviews recent studies on covariate shift, focusing on methods for detecting and correcting this phenomenon. Signal processing and machine learning techniques can be employed to normalize the EEG signal and address the covariate shift.

Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has become increasingly critical due to the rapid deterioration of civil infrastructure. Traditional methods involving heavy equipment are costly and time-consuming. Recent SHM approaches use advanced non-contact sensors, IoT, and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses for faster inspections and immersive experiences during inspections. However, current methods lack quantitative damage data, remote collaboration support, and accurate 3D model alignment with the real structure. Recognizing these current challenges, this paper proposes an AR-based system that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) visualization and follows a flexible manipulation approach of 3D holograms to improve structural condition assessments. The proposed framework utilizes the Vuforia software development toolkit to enable the automatic alignment of 3D models to the real structure, ensuring successful model alignment to assist users in accurately visualizing damage locations. The framework also enables flexible manipulation of damage locations, making it easier for users to identify multiple damage points in the 3D models. The system is validated through lab-scale and full-scale bridge use cases, with data transfer performance analyzed under 4G and 5G conditions for remote collaboration. This study demonstrates that the proposed AR-based SHM framework successfully aligns 3D models with real structures, allowing users to manually adjust models and damage locations. The experimental results confirm its feasibility for remote collaborative inspections, highlighting significant improvements with 5G networks. Nevertheless, performance under 4G remains acceptable, ensuring reliability even without 5G coverage.

Abstract: Understanding patients experiences is essential for advancing patient centered care, especially in chronic diseases that require ongoing communication. However, qualitative thematic analysis, the primary approach for exploring these experiences, remains labor intensive, subjective, and difficult to scale. In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models. We also implemented CoTI into a user-facing application to enable AI human interaction in qualitative analysis. However, collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting they may overrely on CoTI and limit their independent critical thinking.

TL;DR: 研究评估了在虚拟现实中情感3D动画生成模型的表现，发现加强情感建模可提升识别准确度，但当前模型在细微情感表达和用户体验上仍显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往对生成模型评估多集中于二维统计指标，无法全面捕捉用户感知的情感，因此需要在用户交互的真实场景中评估3D动画生成模型。

Method: 在虚拟现实环境中评估情感3D动画生成模型，进行了一项用户研究（N=48），检验三种先进的语音驱动3D动画方法在高唤醒和中唤醒两种情感中的感知情感质量。

Result: 结果显示，显式建模情感的方法相比于单纯以语音为驱动的同步方法在情感识别准确度上更高，但在处理细微情感状态如中性情感时受限，面部表情质量相较真实人类表现较低。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了在生成模型开发中纳入以用户为中心的评估的重要性，特定模型在面部表情质量、互动质量和动画享受度上表现不佳，尽管在动画多样性方面得到了积极认可。

Abstract: Social interactions incorporate nonverbal signals to convey emotions alongside speech, including facial expressions and body gestures. Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.

Abstract: Throughout history, a prevailing paradigm in mental healthcare has been one in which distressed people may receive treatment with little understanding around how their experience is perceived by their care provider, and in turn, the decisions made by their provider around how treatment will progress. Paralleling this offline model of care, people who seek mental health support from AI chatbots are similarly provided little context for how their expressions of distress are processed by the model, and subsequently, the logic that may underlie model responses. People in severe distress who turn to AI chatbots for support thus find themselves caught between black boxes, with unique forms of agony that arise from these intersecting opacities, including misinterpreting model outputs or attributing greater capabilities to a model than are yet possible, which has led to documented real-world harms. Building on empirical research from clinical psychology and AI safety, alongside rights-oriented frameworks from medical ethics, we describe how the distinct psychological state induced by severe distress can influence chatbot interaction patterns, and argue that this state of mind (combined with differences in how a user might perceive a chatbot compared to a care provider) uniquely necessitates a higher standard of interpretability in comparison to general AI chatbot use. Drawing inspiration from newer interpretable treatment paradigms, we then describe specific technical and interface design approaches that could be used to adapt interpretability strategies from four specific mental health fields (psychotherapy, community-based crisis intervention, psychiatry, and care authorization) to AI models, including consideration of the role of interpretability in the treatment process and tensions that may arise with greater interpretability.

Abstract: This essay explores a techno-artistic experiment that reanimates a 1980s East German typewriter using a contemporary AI language model. Situated at the intersection of media archaeology and speculative design, the project questions dominant narratives of progress by embedding generative AI in an obsolete, tactile interface. Through public exhibitions and aesthetic intervention, we demonstrate how slowness, friction, and material render artificial intelligence not only visible but open to critical inquiry. Drawing on concepts such as zombie media, technostalgia, and speculative design, we argue that reappropriating outdated technologies enables new forms of critical engagement. Erika - the AI-enabled typewriter - functions as both interface and interruption, making space for reflection, irony, and cultural memory. In a moment of accelerated digital abstraction, projects like this foreground the value of deliberate slowness, experiential materiality, and historical depth. We conclude by advocating for a historicist design sensibility that challenges presentism and reorients human-machine interaction toward alternative, perceived futures.

Motivation: 本研究旨在解决人们对大型语言模型工作原理的认知不足，以及其对社会的长期影响。

Method: 研究采用了一种创新的方法，将旧打字机与大型语言模型聊天机器人结合，进行互动体验，吸引参与者的反馈。

Result: 本研究通过将一台旧打字机与大型语言模型聊天机器人相结合，使1200多名参与者能够亲自体验AI互动。这种方式帮助人们更好地理解AI的可能性和局限性，并为研究人员提供了参与者对AI的概念、期望和担忧的洞见。

Conclusion: 这种互动体验激发了对于技术发展的质疑，并促进了关于信息和沟通流加速对社会影响的讨论。

Abstract: In the 15th century, printing revolutionized the dissemination of information. Innovations such as typewriters and computers have increased the speed and volume of information flows over time. More recent developments in large language models such as ChatGPT enable text to be generated in a matter of seconds. However, many people do not understand how this works and what the long-term implications are. That is why we have "hacked" an old typewriter so that users can interact with an LLM chatbot, which over 1,200 participants have now been able to experience. It helps to understand the possibilities and limitations of AI. It gives us researchers insights into participants' concepts of AI as well as their expectations and concerns. It raises questions about these technological developments and stimulates discussions about the social impact of the intensification and acceleration of information and communication flows.

Motivation: 探讨在手持移动设备中，瞄准输入的性能如何受到目标大小和观察距离的影响，以期找到提高性能的解决方案。

Method: 提出GAUI（基于视线的自适应用户界面），通过动态调整目标大小来适应不同的观察距离，以提高用户在移动场景下的操作性能。

Result: 在一个包含24名参与者的两阶段研究中，GAUI表现优于固定目标大小的静态界面，无论是在任务时间还是错误率上均更具优势，同时被参与者评为最喜欢的界面。

Conclusion: 参与者在使用GAUI时的体验受姿势变化的影响，研究提出了针对手持移动设备自适应用户界面的设计指南，以最大化用户在瞄准输入时的性能。

Abstract: Dwell input shows promise for handheld mobile contexts, but its performance is impacted by target size and viewing distance. While fixed target sizes suffice in static setups, in mobile settings, frequent posture changes alter viewing distances, which in turn distort perceived size and hinder dwell performance. We address this through GAUI, a Gaze-based Adaptive User Interface that dynamically resizes targets to maximise performance at the given viewing distance. In a two-phased study (N=24), GAUI leveraged the strengths of its distance-responsive design, outperforming the large UI static baseline in task time, and being less error-prone than the small UI static baseline. It was rated the most preferred interface overall. Participants reflected on using GAUI in six different postures. We discuss how their experience is impacted by posture, and propose guidelines for designing context-aware adaptive UIs for dwell interfaces on handheld mobile devices that maximise performance.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在负重状态下，视线输入与触控输入在移动设备使用中的表现及用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在移动设备使用中常因携带物品而受限，但负重对视线输入性能的影响尚未探讨。

Method: 进行了一个包含24名参与者的用户研究，评估了在负重状态下视线输入（包括视线停留时间及GazeTouch）和触控输入的表现。

Result: 触控输入表现通常更好，而视线输入在有反馈时表现一致，无论参与者是否负重。参与者对输入方式的偏好在负重时更倾向于视线输入，负重时则偏好触控输入。

Conclusion: 研究结果帮助理解负重对视线输入的影响，并为未来移动用户界面的输入方式选择提供依据。

Abstract: The potential of using gaze as an input modality in the mobile context is growing. While users often encumber themselves by carrying objects and using mobile devices while walking, the impact of encumbrance on gaze input performance remains unexplored. To investigate this, we conducted a user study (N=24) to evaluate the effect of encumbrance on the performance of 1) Gaze using Dwell time (with/without visual feedback), 2) GazeTouch (with/without visual feedback), and 3) One- or two-hand touch input. While Touch generally performed better, Gaze, especially with feedback, showed a consistent performance regardless of whether participants were encumbered or unencumbered. Participants' preferences for input modalities varied with encumbrance: they preferred Gaze when encumbered, and touch when unencumbered. Our findings enhance understanding of the effect of encumbrance on gaze input and contribute towards selecting appropriate input modalities in future mobile user interfaces to account for situational impairments.

TL;DR: HEar-ID是一种无声语音接口，使用消费级耳塞实现用户身份验证和无声拼写识别，表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数无声语音接口(SSI)系统无法验证说话者的身份，因此需要一个有效的身份验证解决方案。

Method: 提出HEar-ID，利用消费级主动噪声取消耳塞捕捉低频‘耳语’音频和高频超声反射，通过共享编码器产生特征嵌入，供对比分支进行用户身份验证，并用于无声拼写识别。

Result: HEar-ID能够解码50个单词，同时可靠地拒绝冒名顶替者，所有功能均在单一模型上实现，使用普通耳塞。

Conclusion: 实验表明，HEar-ID在拼写准确性和身份验证方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Silent speech interface (SSI) enables hands-free input without audible vocalization, but most SSI systems do not verify speaker identity. We present HEar-ID, which uses consumer active noise-canceling earbuds to capture low-frequency "whisper" audio and high-frequency ultrasonic reflections. Features from both streams pass through a shared encoder, producing embeddings that feed a contrastive branch for user authentication and an SSI head for silent spelling recognition. This design supports decoding of 50 words while reliably rejecting impostors, all on commodity earbuds with a single model. Experiments demonstrate that HEar-ID achieves strong spelling accuracy and robust authentication.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型在与人类交互中产生的认知失误，强调理解 AI 失误需重新审视评估作为一种关系性解释过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在分析大型语言模型在推理过程中的认知失误如何影响人类判断，特别是这些失误的表现和掩盖机制。

Method: 通过三轮多大型语言模型评估，采用跨学科任务和逐步细化的评估框架观察评估者对模型响应的解读。

Result: 研究发现，错误从预测性转为阐释性，评估者往往混淆正确性、相关性、偏见等标准，导致认知简化，从而降低对错误回答的警觉性。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，AI 的认知失误不仅是模型行为的属性，而是生成的合理性与人类理解简化共同构建的结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.
