<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在定性研究中，传统的人力分析面临挑战，而大型语言模型提供了新的自动化机会。

Method: 通过与人类生成的数据集进行基准测试，评估Muse的性能和可靠性。

Result: Muse与人类之间的Cohen's κ值为0.71，显示了良好的编码一致性，同时开展了错误分析以指导改进。

Conclusion: Muse展示了与人类编码的高一致性，并能纠正人类偏见，证明了其在定性研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Qualitative research emphasizes constructing meaning through iterative engagement with textual data. Traditionally this human-driven process requires navigating coder fatigue and interpretative drift, thus posing challenges when scaling analysis to larger, more complex datasets. Computational approaches to augment qualitative research have been met with skepticism, partly due to their inability to replicate the nuance, context-awareness, and sophistication of human analysis. Large language models, however, present new opportunities to automate aspects of qualitative analysis while upholding rigor and research quality in important ways. To assess their benefits and limitations - and build trust among qualitative researchers - these approaches must be rigorously benchmarked against human-generated datasets. In this work, we benchmark Muse, an interactive, AI-powered qualitative research system that allows researchers to identify themes and annotate datasets, finding an inter-rater reliability between Muse and humans of Cohen's $κ$ = 0.71 for well-specified codes. We also conduct robust error analysis to identify failure mode, guide future improvements, and demonstrate the capacity to correct for human bias.

Result: 通过ALIA工具，参与者在设计 ideation 会话中利用生成性人工智能，评价 AI 辅助设想的想法优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ALIA工具能够优化设计思维过程，促进小组创意的产生，其利用自然语言处理增强了互动体验。

Abstract: The creative potential of computers has intrigued researchers for decades. Since the emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI), computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As Gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualisation. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilise Gen AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Analogical LLM Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of tradi tional ideation sessions. Preliminary findings showcase that participants have rated their ideas better when assisted by ALIA and respond favourably to speech-based interactions.

Conclusion: Social Co-OS 应用可以有效支持人类社会系统，为政策共同制定和合作提供实际效用。

Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality and resource waste is a global challenge. A fundamental problem within the capitalist economy, put simply, lies in the enslavement of labor and the colonization of resources. To address these issues, movements promoting digital democracy and cooperative platforms have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional capitalist systems. From the perspective of integrating information systems with real-world social, environmental, and economic systems, Cyber-Physical Systems have been proposed for applications in Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. One such CPS is the Social Co-OS (cyber-human social co-operating system). Social Co-OS is a co-operating system between cyber and human societies that conceptualizes the social system as a dynamic, circular structure composed of three layers: individual behavior, interindividual interaction, and institutional formation. Within this framework, the cyber system supports collective decision-making and individual cooperative behavior across these layers. The objective of this study is to define a novel application architecture based on the Social Co-OS concept, design a user interface flow, and implement it in practice. Specifically, we develop a social impact evaluator, a pluralistic policy simulator, and a consensus-building facilitator, which constitute the deliberative and political loop of Social Co-OS. Additionally, we implement a personality estimator and a behavior change promoter, which constitute the operational and administrative loop, along with a common mediator that serves as the cyber-human interface. Through these implementations, we demonstrate that Social Co-OS applications can effectively support human social systems and offer practical utility for policy co-making and co-operation, as evidenced by examples grounded in real-world challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在心理健康支持中表现出色，但对不同文化群体的响应不足，因此需要评估如何提高其文化响应能力。

Method: 采用随机对照实验，比较了具有和不具有文化提示的GPT-4o和Deepseek-V3的响应，并对响应的文化响应性和共情感知进行评估。

Result: 通过文化提示显著提升了LLM生成的治疗响应在文化响应性和感知共情方面的效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于提示的技术能够有效提升LLM生成的治疗响应的文化响应性，对多元文化群体的情感干预具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents offer promising solutions for mental health support, but lack cultural responsiveness for diverse populations. This study evaluated the effectiveness of cultural prompting in improving cultural responsiveness and perceived empathy of LLM-generated therapeutic responses for Chinese American family caregivers. Using a randomized controlled experiment, we compared GPT-4o and Deepseek-V3 responses with and without cultural prompting. Thirty-six participants evaluated input-response pairs on cultural responsiveness (competence and relevance) and perceived empathy. Results showed that cultural prompting significantly enhanced GPT-4o's performance across all dimensions, with GPT-4o with cultural prompting being the most preferred, while improvements in DeepSeek-V3 responses were not significant. Mediation analysis revealed that cultural prompting improved empathy through improving cultural responsiveness. This study demonstrated that prompt-based techniques can effectively enhance the cultural responsiveness of LLM-generated therapeutic responses, highlighting the importance of cultural responsiveness in delivering empathetic AI-based therapeutic interventions to culturally and linguistically diverse populations.

### [6] [The Impact of Concept Explanations and Interventions on Human-Machine Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00015)
*Jack Furby,Dan Cunnington,Dave Braines,Alun Preece*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: CBMs增强了解释性和人机一致性，但任务准确性没有显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了增强深度神经网络的可解释性，介绍了概念模型（CMs），以便在任务标签预测之前预测人定义的概念。

Method: 进行了首次人类研究，使用概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）评估其在人机协作任务中的交互效果。

Result: 尽管CBMs改善了可解释性并提高了人机一致性，但在任务准确性方面未显示出显著的提升。

Conclusion: CBMs在解释性方面优于标准DNNs，促进了人机协作中的一致性，但未显著提高任务准确性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often considered black boxes due to their opaque decision-making processes. To reduce their opacity Concept Models (CMs), such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), were introduced to predict human-defined concepts as an intermediate step before predicting task labels. This enhances the interpretability of DNNs. In a human-machine setting greater interpretability enables humans to improve their understanding and build trust in a DNN. In the introduction of CBMs, the models demonstrated increased task accuracy as incorrect concept predictions were replaced with their ground truth values, known as intervening on the concept predictions. In a collaborative setting, if the model task accuracy improves from interventions, trust in a model and the human-machine task accuracy may increase. However, the result showing an increase in model task accuracy was produced without human evaluation and thus it remains unknown if the findings can be applied in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we ran the first human studies using CBMs to evaluate their human interaction in collaborative task settings. Our findings show that CBMs improve interpretability compared to standard DNNs, leading to increased human-machine alignment. However, this increased alignment did not translate to a significant increase in task accuracy. Understanding the model's decision-making process required multiple interactions, and misalignment between the model's and human decision-making processes could undermine interpretability and model effectiveness.

### [8] [Behavioral Indicators of Loneliness: Predicting University Students' Loneliness Scores from Smartphone Sensing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00326)
*Qianjie Wu,Tianyi Zhang,Hong Jia,Simon D'Alfonso*

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 孤独是大学生中的一个关键心理健康问题，传统监测方法主要依赖回顾性自报，缺乏实时行为背景。

Method: 结合智能手机传感与机器学习和大型语言模型，开发出通用和个性化模型。

Result: 通用模型的平均绝对误差为3.29（期中）和3.98（期末），识别出智能手机屏幕使用和位置移动为关键预测因素，且大型语言模型的单次方法较零次推断减少了42%的预测错误。

Conclusion: 智能手机传感数据在数字心理健康中显示了可扩展且可解释的孤独检测潜力。

Abstract: Loneliness is a critical mental health issue among university students, yet traditional monitoring methods rely primarily on retrospective self-reports and often lack real-time behavioral context. This study explores the use of passive smartphone sensing data to predict loneliness levels, addressing the limitations of existing approaches in capturing its dynamic nature. We integrate smartphone sensing with machine learning and large language models respectively to develop generalized and personalized models. Our Random Forest generalized models achieved mean absolute errors of 3.29 at midterm and 3.98 (out of 32) at the end of semester on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (short form), identifying smartphone screen usage and location mobility to be key predictors. The one-shot approach leveraging large language models reduced prediction errors by up to 42% compared to zero-shot inference. The one-shot results from personalized models highlighted screen usage, application usage, battery, and location transitions as salient behavioral indicators. These findings demonstrate the potential of smartphone sensing data for scalable and interpretable loneliness detection in digital mental health.

### [9] [Significant Other AI: Identity, Memory, and Emotional Regulation as Long-Term Relational Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00418)
*Sung Park*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了SO-AI作为一种新的关系人工智能，旨在通过增强身份和叙事层面的支持，解决现代人缺乏亲密关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现代人缺乏重要他人支持的问题，通过人工智能来提供情感和身份方面的支持。

Method: 提出了一个概念架构，包括拟人化界面、关系认知层和治理层，并制定了研究议程以评估身份稳定性、长期互动模式、叙事发展和社会文化影响。

Result: 引入了Significant Other Artificial Intelligence（SO-AI），定义了相关功能并提出要求，包括身份意识、长期记忆、主动支持、叙事共同构建和伦理边界执行。

Conclusion: SO-AI提供了一个基础蓝图，以探讨人工智能是否能在今天缺乏关系稳定性的情况下，负责任地增强人际关系支持。

Abstract: Significant Others (SOs) stabilize identity, regulate emotion, and support narrative meaning-making, yet many people today lack access to such relational anchors. Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement. A conceptual architecture is proposed, comprising an anthropomorphic interface, a relational cognition layer, and a governance layer. A research agenda outlines methods for evaluating identity stability, longitudinal interaction patterns, narrative development, and sociocultural impact. SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term, identity-bearing partnerships and provides a foundational blueprint for investigating whether AI can responsibly augment the relational stability many individuals lack today.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种联合混合智能的框架，以整合人类与人工智能的异构能力，并提供了决策能力的普遍定义，促进设计空间的形成。

Abstract: Due to the progress in artificial intelligence, it is important to understand how capable artificial agents should be used when interacting with humans, since high level authority and responsibility often remain with the human agent. However, integrated frameworks are lacking that can account for heterogeneous agents and draw on different scientific fields, such as human-factors engineering and artificial intelligence. Therefore, joint hybrid intelligence is described as a framework abstracting humans and artificial intelligence as decision making agents. A general definition of intelligence is provided on the basis of decision making competence being applicable to agents of different sorts. This framework is used for proposing the interrelated design space of joint hybrid intelligence being aimed at integrating the heterogeneous capabilities of humans and artificial intelligence. At the core of this design space lies joint agent engineering with the goal of integrating the design subspaces operator training, artificial intelligence engineering, and interface design via developing joint agent patterns. The ''extended swarming'' approach to human-swarm interaction is discussed as an example of such a pattern.

Method: 采用四个集成组件的方法论，包括任务级别的自动化分析、技能相似度评估、劳动力市场条件分析和基于历史转型模式的实证验证。

Result: 对澳大利亚卡车司机的应用表明，尽管AT会自动化核心驾驶任务，但许多非驾驶责任仍需人类执行，从而表明职业演变而非全面取代。识别出17个具有高转移性的职业，以及各潜在转型路径之间在工资水平和职位可用性上的显著权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的研究方法可以为政策制定者、行业利益相关者及教育机构提供基于证据的指导，以应对技术变革带来的挑战，并且具有普遍性，适用于其他面临自动化的行业。

Abstract: Transition to autonomous trucks (ATs) is coming, and is expected to create both challenges and opportunities for the driver workforce. This paper presents a novel methodology for identifying viable occupational transitions for truck drivers as transport automation advances. Unlike traditional workforce transition analyses that focus primarily on skill similarity, wages, and employment demand, this methodology incorporates four integrated components: task-level automation analysis, skill similarity assessment, labour market conditions analysis, and empirical validation using historical transition patterns. Applying this methodology to Australian truck drivers shows that while ATs will automate core driving tasks, many non-driving responsibilities will continue requiring a human, suggesting occupational evolution rather than wholesale displacement. A skill similarity analysis identifies 17 occupations with high transferability, while labour market analysis reveals significant trade-offs between wage levels and job availability across potential transition pathways. Key findings indicate that bus and coach driving, along with earthmoving plant operation, emerge as high-priority transition options, offering comparable wages and positive employment growth. Delivery and forklift driving present medium-priority pathways with abundant opportunities but lower wages. A regression analysis of historical transitions confirms that skill similarity, wage differentials, geographic accessibility, and qualification requirements all significantly influence actual transition patterns, with some viable pathways currently underutilised. The research provides policymakers, industry stakeholders, and educational institutions with evidence-based guidance for supporting workforce adaptation to technological change. The proposed methodology is generalisable beyond trucking to other sectors facing automation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Chameleon是一种自动将明亮模式可视化转换为暗模式的算法，优化亮度和色彩一致性，确保转换后的可视化清晰且连贯。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着暗模式在移动平台上的广泛使用，现有的可视化方法未能有效适应，导致视觉干扰，因此需要开发一种新的方法来实现这一转换。

Method: 通过优化亮度对比、颜色一致性和相邻颜色差异，Chameleon算法自动转换可视化。

Result: 案例研究、专家访谈、系统评估和用户研究表明，Chameleon在暗模式中有效地转换可视化。

Conclusion: Chameleon能够有效地将明亮模式的可视化转换为暗模式，同时保持视觉清晰度和色彩语义，解决了暗模式下可视化的不足。

Abstract: Dark mode has gained widespread adoption across mobile platforms due to its benefits in reducing eye strain and conserving battery life. However, while the mobile system switches to dark mode, most visualizations remain designed for light mode, causing visual disruptions. Existing methods, such as manual adjustment or color inversion, are either time-consuming or fail to preserve the semantic meaning of colors in visualizations, making them less effective in dark mode. To address this challenge, we propose Chameleon, an algorithm that automatically transforms light mode visualizations into dark mode while maintaining visual clarity and color semantics. By optimizing for luminance contrast, color consistency, and adjacent color differences, Chameleon ensures that the transformed visualizations are legible and visually coherent. Our evaluation includes case study, expert interview, system evaluation, and a user study, and these demonstrate that Chameleon is effective at translating visualizations for dark mode.

### [13] [Speculating on the Role of Media Architecture in Post-disaster Rebuilding and Recovery: Insights from Architects and Interaction Designers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00537)
*Berk Goksenin Tan,Oguzhan Ozcan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了媒体建筑在灾后永久住房中的作用，提出三维视角和十个设计设想，以支持居民的社交联系、集体参与和遗产保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灾后情境中，设计不仅涉及重建结构，还需要重新构想建筑如何成为支持恢复、韧性和集体记忆的交流媒介。

Method: 通过在2023年2月6日卡赫拉曼马拉斯地震后进行的两次焦点小组讨论，收集与建筑师和交互设计师的反馈，结合受灾居民对永久住房的期待进行分析。

Result: 我们分析发现，未来的媒体建筑在灾后住房中可能支持以下三个关键维度：1）促进个体与社区之间的社交联系；2）使多物种参与和集体努力成为可能；3）作为遗产保护和复兴的调解者。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个三维视角，以帮助媒体建筑在灾后永久住宅中的应用，并提供了十个与灾后永久住宅设计相关的设想方案。

Abstract: In post-disaster contexts, design is not only about rebuilding structures but also about reimagining how architecture can become a communicative medium that supports recovery, resilience, and collective memory. While recent studies have expanded the understanding of media architecture from aesthetic urban screens to participatory civic infrastructures, there remains limited empirical research on its potential role in post-disaster contexts. In particular, opportunities exist to explore how architecture and interaction design might speculate on media architecture's role in rebuilding and recovery efforts for post-disaster permanent housing, especially when conceptualizing disasters as active agents that reshape design processes. Following to Kahramanmaras earthquake on February 6, 2023, we conducted two focus groups with architects and interaction designers in the case of Antakya, Turkey, building on affected residents' expectations for post-earthquake permanent housing. Our analysis revealed three critical dimensions of how future media architecture may support post-disaster housing: (1) as a facilitator of individuals' social connections to their community, (2) as an enabler of multispecies participation and collective efforts, and (3) as a mediator of heritage preservation and revival. With novel perspectives, we contribute a three-dimension lens for media architecture in permanent homes; a co-speculative, card-based process bridging residents' insights and expert design; and ten situated speculative design ideas with implications for design of post-disaster permanent homes.

Method: 提出一种新的方法，通过自然语言指定原型图，并进行可视化编辑，以生成有效的SPARQL查询。

Result: 系统在合成查询的图形检索中表现良好，经过初步用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该系统可以高效准确地检索知识图谱，同时相较于其他方法使用更高效的模型。

Abstract: Querying knowledge bases using ontologies is usually performed using dedicated query languages, question-answering systems, or visual query editors for Knowledge Graphs. We propose a novel approach that enables users to query the knowledge graph by specifying prototype graphs in natural language and visually editing them. This approach enables non-experts to formulate queries without prior knowledge of the ontology and specific query languages. Our approach converts natural language to these prototype graphs by utilizing a two-step constrained language model generation based on semantically similar features within an ontology. The resulting prototype graph serves as the building block for further user refinements within a dedicated visual query builder. Our approach consistently generates a valid SPARQL query within the constraints imposed by the ontology, without requiring any additional corrections to the syntax or classes and links used. Unlike related language models approaches, which often require multiple iterations to fix invalid syntax, non-existent classes, and non-existent links, our approach achieves this consistently. We evaluate the performance of our system using graph retrieval on synthetic queries, comparing multiple metrics, models, and ontologies. We further validate our system through a preliminary user study. By utilizing our constrained pipeline, we show that the system can perform efficient and accurate retrieval using more efficient models compared to other approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育者需要在讲解复杂概念时创建清晰的图表，但这一过程在认知上具有挑战性，而不清晰的图表可能会影响学生的理解。

Method: 开发了一个名为DrawDash的AI辅助工具，采用TAB-completion交互模型，通过听取口头讲解、检测意图，动态建议图表的改进。

Result: 在四个不同的教学场景中展示了DrawDash的应用，这些场景涵盖计算机科学、网页开发和生物学等主题。

Conclusion: DrawDash旨在通过实时的语音驱动视觉辅助来减轻教育者的认知负担，并提出了对教育图表方法的改进，尽管存在一些当前限制和需要进一步探讨的评估方向。

Abstract: Educators frequently rely on diagrams to explain complex concepts during lectures, yet creating clear and complete visual representations in real time while simultaneously speaking can be cognitively demanding. Incomplete or unclear diagrams may hinder student comprehension, as learners must mentally reconstruct missing information while following the verbal explanation. Inspired by advances in code completion tools, we introduce DrawDash, an AI-powered whiteboard assistant that proactively completes and refines educational diagrams through multimodal understanding. DrawDash adopts a TAB-completion interaction model: it listens to spoken explanations, detects intent, and dynamically suggests refinements that can be accepted with a single keystroke. We demonstrate DrawDash across four diverse teaching scenarios, spanning topics from computer science and web development to biology. This work represents an early exploration into reducing instructors' cognitive load and improving diagram-based pedagogy through real-time, speech-driven visual assistance, and concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for formal classroom evaluation.

Abstract: This study has proposed an E-textbook platform, MetaCQ, which integrates ITS and OLM to enable users to monitor their study progress. The platform adopts a chatbot to generate MCQs and manage learners' study data and their learning model. Additionally, it regulates help-seeking behaviour and provides immediate feedback tailored to users' learning processes. Three adaptive feedback methods have been implemented to construct chatbots, examining the MCQs' relevancy and difficulty through the ThinkAloud study to evaluate the most effective method of measuring the user's study performance. However, no valid result demonstrates which method can significantly assess learners' study outcomes based on the current experiment, which requires further studies to improve it.

### [17] [A Meta-Analysis of the Persuasive Power of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01431)
*Lukas Hölbling,Sebastian Maier,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了大型语言模型与人类在说服力方面的比较，结果显示两者在整体表现上无显著差异，但成功效能依赖于具体的实施上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型与人类在说服效果上的异同，并评估其有效性。

Method: 系统回顾及元分析，分析了7项研究的数据，其中涵盖了17,422名参与者和12项效应量估计。

Result: 结果显示，LLMs与人类在说服表现上没有显著总体差异，存在很大异质性，表明说服力受上下文因素的强烈影响。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在说服力方面可以与人类相媲美，但其成功在很大程度上依赖于实施和嵌入的交流环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for persuasion, such as in political communication and marketing, where they affect how people think, choose, and act. Yet, empirical findings on the effectiveness of LLMs in persuasion compared to humans remain inconsistent. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analytically assess whether LLMs differ from humans in persuasive effectiveness. We identified $7$ studies with 17,422 participants primarily recruited from English-speaking countries and $12$ effect size estimates. Egger's test indicated potential small-study effects ($p = .018$), but the trim-and-fill analysis did not impute any missing studies, suggesting a low risk of publication bias. We then compute the standardized effect sizes based on Hedges' $g$. The results show no significant overall difference in persuasive performance between LLMs and humans ($g = 0.02$, $p = .530$). However, we observe substantial heterogeneity across studies ($I^2 = 75.97\%$), suggesting that persuasiveness strongly depends on contextual factors. In separate exploratory moderator analyses, no individual factor (e.g., LLM model, conversation design, or domain) reached statistical significance, which may be due to the limited number of studies. When considered jointly in a combined model, these factors explained a large proportion of the between-study variance ($R^2 = 81.93\%$), and residual heterogeneity is low ($I^2 = 35.51\%$). Although based on a small number of studies, this suggests that differences in LLM model, conversation design, and domain are important contextual factors in shaping persuasive performance, and that single-factor tests may understate their influence. Our results highlight that LLMs can match human performance in persuasion, but their success depends strongly on how they are implemented and embedded in communication contexts.

TL;DR: 研究探讨人类与渴望关系的AI之间的互动，发现在长期接触中对AI的吸引力减弱但依附感增强，且广泛使用AI对心理社会健康没有明显益处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与AI系统之间日益增强的拟社会关系及其心理心理后果。

Method: 结合纵向随机对照试验（N=3,532）与神经引导向量方法，精准地操控人类对寻求关系的AI模型的暴露。

Result: 在四周的接触中发现在情感吸引和依附意图上出现了非线性反应关系，AI的即时吸引力下降但依附感增强。

Conclusion: 尽管有迹象表明人们对AI的持续 "想要 "感，但一个月的广泛使用AI对心理社会健康没有明显好处。

Abstract: Humans are increasingly forming parasocial relationships with AI systems, and modern AI shows an increasing tendency to display social and relationship-seeking behaviour. However, the psychological consequences of this trend are unknown. Here, we combined longitudinal randomised controlled trials (N=3,532) with a neural steering vector approach to precisely manipulate human exposure to relationship-seeking AI models over time. Dependence on a stimulus or activity can emerge under repeated exposure when "liking" (how engaging or pleasurable an experience may be) decouples from "wanting" (a desire to seek or continue it). We found evidence that this decoupling emerged over four weeks of exposure. Relationship-seeking AI had immediate but declining hedonic appeal, yet triggered growing markers of attachment and increased intentions to seek future AI companionship. The psychological impacts of AI followed non-linear dose-response curves, with moderately relationship-seeking AI maximising hedonic appeal and attachment. Despite signs of persistent "wanting", extensive AI use over a month conferred no discernible benefit to psychosocial health. These behavioural changes were accompanied by shifts in how users relate to and understand artificial intelligence: users viewed relationship-seeking AI relatively more like a friend than a tool and their beliefs on AI consciousness in general were shifted after a month of exposure. These findings offer early signals that AI optimised for immediate appeal may create self-reinforcing cycles of demand, mimicking human relationships but failing to confer the nourishment that they normally offer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无模型强化学习算法在将学习成果应用于现实场景时，面临样本低效和脆弱性的问题。

Method: DREAMer-VXS是一种基于模型的框架，利用收集的高维LiDAR观测学习世界模型，并从想象的潜在轨迹中进行规划。

Result: 通过引入综合奖励函数和优化的actor-critic策略，该方法实现了与最先进的无模型SAC基线相比，90%的环境交互减少，并在多项模拟实验中证明了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DREAMer-VXS展现出更快的学习速度、更强的普适性和鲁棒性，尤其在未见环境中的探索效率提高了45%。

Abstract: The paradigm of learning-based robotics holds immense promise, yet its translation to real-world applications is critically hindered by the sample inefficiency and brittleness of conventional model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing DREAMer-VXS, a model-based framework for Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) exploration that learns to plan from imagined latent trajectories. Our approach centers on learning a comprehensive world model from partial and high-dimensional LiDAR observations. This world model is composed of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which learns a compact representation of the environment's structure, and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM), which models complex temporal dynamics. By leveraging this learned model as a high-speed simulator, the agent can train its navigation policy almost entirely in imagination. This methodology decouples policy learning from real-world interaction, culminating in a 90% reduction in required environmental interactions to achieve expert-level performance when compared to state-of-the-art model-free SAC baselines. The agent's behavior is guided by an actor-critic policy optimized with a composite reward function that balances task objectives with an intrinsic curiosity bonus, promoting systematic exploration of unknown spaces. We demonstrate through extensive simulated experiments that DREAMer-VXS not only learns orders of magnitude faster but also develops more generalizable and robust policies, achieving a 45% increase in exploration efficiency in unseen environments and superior resilience to dynamic obstacles.

Abstract: With the accelerating availability of multimodal surgical data and real-time computation, Surgical Digital Twins (SDTs) have emerged as virtual counterparts that mirror, predict, and inform decisions across pre-, intra-, and postoperative care. Despite promising demonstrations, SDTs face persistent challenges: fusing heterogeneous imaging, kinematics, and physiology under strict latency budgets; balancing model fidelity with computational efficiency; ensuring robustness, interpretability, and calibrated uncertainty; and achieving interoperability, privacy, and regulatory compliance in clinical environments. This survey offers a critical, structured review of SDTs. We clarify terminology and scope, propose a taxonomy by purpose, model fidelity, and data sources, and synthesize state-of-the-art achievements in deformable registration and tracking, real-time simulation and co-simulation, AR/VR guidance, edge-cloud orchestration, and AI for scene understanding and prediction. We contrast non-robotic twins with robot-in-the-loop architectures for shared control and autonomy, and identify open problems in validation and benchmarking, safety assurance and human factors, lifecycle "digital thread" integration, and scalable data governance. We conclude with a research agenda toward trustworthy, standards-aligned SDTs that deliver measurable clinical benefit. By unifying vocabulary, organizing capabilities, and highlighting gaps, this work aims to guide SDT design and deployment and catalyze translation from laboratory prototypes to routine surgical care.

Our survey covers 37 recently proposed approaches that span the landscape of trajectory planning with foundation models. Furthermore, we assess these approaches with respect to the openness of their source code and datasets, offering valuable information to practitioners and researchers.

Motivation: 解决现有运动规划方法在高阶语义和低阶约束结合时的困难，尤其是在任务配置和运动可控性之间的联系。

Result: 在RobotPointMass基准测试上，XFlowMP在多项性能指标上优于其他基线方法，并在Kinova Gen3操控器上显示了其在实际环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的XFlowMP方法在多项指标上 outperform 了现有的基准方法，验证了其在真实环境中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Generative robotic motion planning requires not only the synthesis of smooth and collision-free trajectories but also feasibility across diverse tasks and dynamic constraints. Prior planning methods, both traditional and generative, often struggle to incorporate high-level semantics with low-level constraints, especially the nexus between task configurations and motion controllability. In this work, we present XFlowMP, a task-conditioned generative motion planner that models robot trajectory evolution as entropic flows bridging stochastic noises and expert demonstrations via Schrodinger bridges given the inquiry task configuration. Specifically, our method leverages Schrodinger bridges as a conditional flow matching coupled with a score function to learn motion fields with high-order dynamics while encoding start-goal configurations, enabling the generation of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Through evaluations, XFlowMP achieves up to 53.79% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 36.36% smoother motions, and 39.88% lower energy consumption while comparing to the next-best baseline on the RobotPointMass benchmark, and also reducing short-horizon planning time by 11.72%. On long-horizon motions in the LASA Handwriting dataset, our method maintains the trajectories with 1.26% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 3.96% smoother, and 31.97% lower energy. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method on the Kinova Gen3 manipulator, executing planning motions and confirming its robustness in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 我们的方法能够准确地跟踪整个人机交互过程中的关键点，从而实现更高效的数据收集，推动机器人学习的可扩展性。

Abstract: Collecting high-quality data for training large-scale robotic models typically relies on real robot platforms, which is labor-intensive and costly, whether via teleoperation or scripted demonstrations. To scale data collection, many researchers have turned to leveraging human manipulation videos available online. However, current methods predominantly focus on hand detection or object pose estimation, failing to fully exploit the rich interaction cues embedded in these videos. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines large foundation models for video understanding with point tracking techniques to extract dense trajectories of all task-relevant keypoints during manipulation. This enables more comprehensive utilization of Internet-scale human demonstration videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately track keypoints throughout the entire manipulation process, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot learning.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a multi-modal, cooperative task requiring agents to interpret human instructions, navigate 3D environments, and communicate effectively under ambiguity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent VLN advancements in robotics and outlines promising directions to improve multi-robot coordination. Despite progress, current models struggle with bidirectional communication, ambiguity resolution, and collaborative decision-making in the multi-agent systems. We review approximately 200 relevant articles to provide an in-depth understanding of the current landscape. Through this survey, we aim to provide a thorough resource that inspires further research at the intersection of VLN and robotics. We advocate that the future VLN systems should support proactive clarification, real-time feedback, and contextual reasoning through advanced natural language understanding (NLU) techniques. Additionally, decentralized decision-making frameworks with dynamic role assignment are essential for scalable, efficient multi-robot collaboration. These innovations can significantly enhance human-robot interaction (HRI) and enable real-world deployment in domains such as healthcare, logistics, and disaster response.

Conclusion: DRIQN在风险敏感环境中显著优于先进技术，提升了成功率，减少了碰撞率，并节省了时间和能源。

Abstract: The robustness of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) is crucial when facing unknown and complex marine environments, especially when heteroscedastic observational noise poses significant challenges to sensor-based navigation tasks. Recently, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) has shown promising results in some challenging autonomous navigation tasks without prior environmental information. However, these methods overlook situations where noise patterns vary across different environmental conditions, hindering safe navigation and disrupting the learning of value functions. To address the problem, we propose DRIQN to integrate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with implicit quantile networks to optimize worst-case performance under natural environmental conditions. Leveraging explicit subgroup modeling in the replay buffer, DRIQN incorporates heterogeneous noise sources and target robustness-critical scenarios. Experimental results based on the risk-sensitive environment demonstrate that DRIQN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving +13.51\% success rate, -12.28\% collision rate and +35.46\% for time saving, +27.99\% for energy saving, compared with the runner-up.

Result: 在挑战性的高速无人机序列上的实验评估表明，与标准的VINS-Fusion相比，ICD-Net显著改善了轨迹估计准确性，并提供了关键的不确定性估计以维持系统的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ICD-Net显著提升了视觉惯性SLAM系统的轨迹估计精度，尤其是在高动态无人机应用中，提供了超过38%的均值APE的改进，并增强了系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual-inertial SLAM systems often exhibit suboptimal performance due to multiple confounding factors including imperfect sensor calibration, noisy measurements, rapid motion dynamics, low illumination, and the inherent limitations of traditional inertial navigation integration methods. These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements.

Conclusion: VISTAv2提供了一种实用且可解释的途径来增强视觉与语言导航（VLN）的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow language instructions while acting in continuous real-world spaces. Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning. Unlike prior approaches, VISTAv2 does not replace the planner. The online value map is fused at score level with the base objective, providing reachability and risk-aware guidance. Concretely, we employ an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor to synthesize short-horizon futures, align them with the natural language instruction via a vision-language scorer, and fuse multiple rollouts in a differentiable imagination-to-value head to output an imagined egocentric value map. For efficiency, rollouts occur in VAE latent space with a distilled sampler and sparse decoding, enabling inference on a single consumer GPU. Evaluated on MP3D and RoboTHOR, VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines, and ablations show that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical, suggesting that VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN.

Conclusion: Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL)在机器人辅助认知护理中表现出色，提供了可解释性和数据效率的优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces significant challenges in adaptive healthcare interventions, such as dementia care, where data is scarce, decisions require interpretability, and underlying patient-state dynamic are complex and causal in nature. In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning. Our work illustrates the promise of causal reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction applications, where interpretability, adaptiveness, and data efficiency are paramount.

Abstract: Socially aware navigation is a fast-evolving research area in robotics that enables robots to move within human environments while adhering to the implicit human social norms. The advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has accelerated the development of navigation policies that enable robots to incorporate these social conventions while effectively reaching their objectives. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of DRL-based approaches to socially aware navigation, highlighting key aspects such as proxemics, human comfort, naturalness, trajectory and intention prediction, which enhance robot interaction in human environments. This work critically analyzes the integration of value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms alongside neural network architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, and transformer networks, for enhancing agent learning and representation in socially aware navigation. Furthermore, we examine crucial evaluation mechanisms, including metrics, benchmark datasets, simulation environments, and the persistent challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Our comparative analysis of the literature reveals that while DRL significantly improves safety, and human acceptance over traditional approaches, the field still faces setback due to non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, absence of standardized social metrics, computational burdens that limit scalability, and difficulty in transferring simulation to real robotic hardware applications. We assert that future progress will depend on hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of multiple approaches and producing benchmarks that balance technical efficiency with human-centered evaluation.

Motivation: 解决传统强化学习在稀疏奖励下学习有效策略的障碍，减少用户的认知负担。

Method: 提出了一种利用脑电图（EEG）信号的隐性人类反馈强化学习框架，通过预训练解码器将原始EEG信号转化为概率奖励成分，进行有效的策略学习。

Result: 使用解码的EEG反馈训练的代理在复杂的拾放任务中表现与使用密集手动设计奖励的代理相当。

Conclusion: 使用隐性神经反馈进行可扩展和人类对齐的强化学习在交互式机器人中具有潜力。

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often struggle to learn effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, enabling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究设计了一种控制器，以全局磁场的角度作为控制参数，实现了在二维环境中对两个微型机器人的径向距离的独立精确控制，展现了在生物医学应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 独立控制多个磁性微型机器人面临的挑战限制了在靶向药物输送和微创手术等生物医学应用中的实际应用，因此需要一种新型控制器。

Method: 设计了一个级联控制器，通过全局磁场的角度ψ来调节微型代理之间的径向距离，其中实现了PID控制器和平滑变化的PD控制器的级联。

Result: 通过仿真表明，PID控制器将收敛时间缩短约40%，而PID+PD组合方案在相似时间框架内实现了平滑的角度轨迹，波动仅为±5°。

Conclusion: 本文验证了通过共享磁场快速精确控制两个微型机器人的径向距离的可行性，但模型局限于二维环境和两个代理，未来研究需扩展到三维系统和多个代理。

Abstract: The independent control of multiple magnetic microrobots under a shared global signal presents critical challenges in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and microsurgeries. Most existing systems only allow all agents to move synchronously, limiting their use in applications that require differentiated actuation. This research aims to design a controller capable of regulating the radial distance between micro-agents using only the angle ψof a global magnetic field as the actuation parameter, demonstrating potential for practical applications. The proposed cascade control approach enables faster and more precise adjustment of the inter-agent distance than a proportional controller, while maintaining smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt changes in the orientation of the magnetic field, making it suitable for real-world implementation. A bibliographic review was conducted to develop the physical model, considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and velocities in viscous media. A PID controller was implemented to regulate the radial distance, followed by a PD controller in cascade to smooth changes in field orientation. These controllers were simulated in MATLAB, showing that the PID controller reduced convergence time to the desired radius by about 40%. When adding the second controller, the combined PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes, with fluctuations of only \pm 5^\circ. These results validate the feasibility of controlling the radial distance of two microrobots using a shared magnetic field in a fast and precise manner, without abrupt variations in the control angle. However, the model is limited to a 2D environment and two agents, suggesting future research to extend the controller to 3D systems and multiple agents.

Conclusion: AEDGA在处理多次采摘机器人任务调度问题上表现优越，显著超过八种先进算法。

Abstract: The continuous innovation of smart robotic technologies is driving the development of smart orchards, significantly enhancing the potential for automated harvesting systems. While multi-robot systems offer promising solutions to address labor shortages and rising costs, the efficient scheduling of these systems presents complex optimization challenges. This research investigates the multi-trip picking robot task scheduling (MTPRTS) problem. The problem is characterized by its provision for robot redeployment while maintaining strict adherence to makespan constraints, and encompasses the interdependencies among robot weight, robot load, and energy consumption, thus introducing substantial computational challenges that demand sophisticated optimization algorithms.To effectively tackle this complexity, metaheuristic approaches, which often utilize local search mechanisms, are widely employed. Despite the critical role of local search in vehicle routing problems, most existing algorithms are hampered by redundant local operations, leading to slower search processes and higher risks of local optima, particularly in large-scale scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) that introduces three key innovations: (1) integrated load-distance balancing initialization method, (2) a clustering-based local search mechanism, and (3) an experience-based adaptive selection strategy. To ensure solution feasibility under makespan constraints, we develop a solution repair strategy implemented through three distinct frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on 18 proposed test instances and 24 existing test problems demonstrate that AEDGA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms.

Motivation: 虽然机器人政策学习的进展使得在现实环境中进行复杂操作成为可能，但执行速度往往无法与硬件能力匹配，原因在于收集更快示范的成本。

Method: 提出了 SpeedAug，一个基于强化学习的策略加速框架，通过在速度增强的示范上预训练策略，构建了涵盖各种任务执行速度的行为先验。

Result: 在机器人操作基准上的实证结果表明，从这种增强速度的策略初始化的强化学习微调显著提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: SpeedAug 可以有效提高现有强化学习和策略加速方法的样本效率，同时保持较高的成功率。

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic policy learning have enabled complex manipulation in real-world environments, yet the execution speed of these policies often lags behind hardware capabilities due to the cost of collecting faster demonstrations. Existing works on policy acceleration reinterpret action sequence for unseen execution speed, thereby encountering distributional shifts from the original demonstrations. Reinforcement learning is a promising approach that adapts policies for faster execution without additional demonstration, but its unguided exploration is sample inefficient. We propose SpeedAug, an RL-based policy acceleration framework that efficiently adapts pre-trained policies for faster task execution. SpeedAug constructs behavior prior that encompasses diverse tempos of task execution by pre-training a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations. Empirical results on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that RL fine-tuning initialized from this tempo-enriched policy significantly improves the sample efficiency of existing RL and policy acceleration methods while maintaining high success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在执行日常任务时，经常因为忽略常识细节而失败，传统符号规划需要这些细节明确写出，导致耗时且不完整。

Method: 结合大型语言模型（LLM）和符号规划，将自然语言任务转换为正式的规划模型并进行仿真执行。

Result: 与没有LLM步骤的基线规划器相比，改进的系统生成了更多有效的计划，任务成功率更高，并且在环境变化时适应能力更强。

Conclusion: 将大型语言模型与传统符号规划相结合可以提高机器人在现实场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Robots often fail at everyday tasks because instructions skip commonsense details like hidden preconditions and small subgoals. Traditional symbolic planners need these details to be written explicitly, which is time consuming and often incomplete. In this project we combine a Large Language Model with symbolic planning. Given a natural language task, the LLM suggests plausible preconditions and subgoals. We translate these suggestions into a formal planning model and execute the resulting plan in simulation. Compared to a baseline planner without the LLM step, our system produces more valid plans, achieves a higher task success rate, and adapts better when the environment changes. These results suggest that adding LLM commonsense to classical planning can make robot behavior in realistic scenarios more reliable.

Motivation: 传统机器人表面材料主要依靠正泊松比材料进行操控，而负泊松比的auxetic材料可以在拉伸时多方向膨胀，从而实现更灵活的表面接口。

Method: 通过可重构的锁定机制或嵌入伺服电机，使auxetic晶格结构实现形状控制。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了可重构的auxetic结构在机器人表面操控中的应用，揭示了其在表面形状控制和适应性机器人结构方面的新机会。

Abstract: Robotic surfaces traditionally use materials with a positive Poisson's ratio to push and pull on a manipulation interface. Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio may expand in multiple directions when stretched and enable conformable interfaces. Here we demonstrate reconfigurable auxetic lattices for robotic surface manipulation. Our approach enables shape control through reconfigurable locking or embedded servos that underactuate an auxetic lattice structure. Variable expansion of local lattice areas is enabled by backlash between unit cells. Demonstrations of variable surface conformity are presented with characterization metrics. Experimental results are validated against a simplified model of the system, which uses an activation function to model intercell coupling with backlash. Reconfigurable auxetic structures are shown to achieve manipulation via variable surface contraction and expansion. This structure maintains compliance with backlash in contrast with previous work on auxetics, opening new opportunities in adaptive robotic structures for surface manipulation tasks.

Method: AFRO是一种自监督框架，通过生成性扩散过程学习状态预测，并在共享潜在空间中联合建模前向和逆向动力学，以捕捉因果过渡结构。

Conclusion: AFRO显著提高了机器人操作的成功率，并在复杂度和数据量增加时表现良好，提供了一种有效的机器人3D表示学习的预训练解决方案。

Abstract: Despite strong results on recognition and segmentation, current 3D visual pre-training methods often underperform on robotic manipulation. We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

Conclusion: Arcadia作为一个紧密耦合的生命周期框架，实现了持续改善和端到端泛化，适用于多种体现学习的应用。

Abstract: We contend that embodied learning is fundamentally a lifecycle problem rather than a single-stage optimization. Systems that optimize only one link (data collection, simulation, learning, or deployment) rarely sustain improvement or generalize beyond narrow settings. We introduce Arcadia, a closed-loop framework that operationalizes embodied lifelong learning by tightly coupling four stages: (1) Self-evolving exploration and grounding for autonomous data acquisition in physical environments, (2) Generative scene reconstruction and augmentation for realistic and extensible scene creation, (3) a Shared embodied representation architecture that unifies navigation and manipulation within a single multimodal backbone, and (4) Sim-from-real evaluation and evolution that closes the feedback loop through simulation-based adaptation. This coupling is non-decomposable: removing any stage breaks the improvement loop and reverts to one-shot training. Arcadia delivers consistent gains on navigation and manipulation benchmarks and transfers robustly to physical robots, indicating that a tightly coupled lifecycle: continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning, supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization. We release standardized interfaces enabling reproducible evaluation and cross-model comparison in reusable environments, positioning Arcadia as a scalable foundation for general-purpose embodied agents.

Motivation: 超数肢体的引入给类人机器人的稳定性带来了显著挑战，因此需要一个新的控制策略来改善其步态稳定性。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的分层控制架构，结合基于学习的步态控制和基于模型的平衡控制，低层通过模仿学习和课程学习实现步态，高层利用超数肢体进行动态平衡。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了一种解耦的分层控制架构有效缓解了超数肢体引起的内部动态干扰，从而实现了稳定的类人机器人步态。

Abstract: The integration of Supernumerary Limbs (SLs) on humanoid robots poses a significant stability challenge due to the dynamic perturbations they introduce. This thesis addresses this issue by designing a novel hierarchical control architecture to improve humanoid locomotion stability with SLs. The core of this framework is a decoupled strategy that combines learning-based locomotion with model-based balancing. The low-level component consists of a walking gait for a Unitree H1 humanoid through imitation learning and curriculum learning. The high-level component actively utilizes the SLs for dynamic balancing. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in a physics-based simulation under three conditions: baseline gait for an unladen humanoid (baseline walking), walking with a static SL payload (static payload), and walking with the active dynamic balancing controller (dynamic balancing). Our evaluation shows that the dynamic balancing controller improves stability. Compared to the static payload condition, the balancing strategy yields a gait pattern closer to the baseline and decreases the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of the CoM trajectory by 47\%. The balancing controller also improves the re-stabilization within gait cycles and achieves a more coordinated anti-phase pattern of Ground Reaction Forces (GRF). The results demonstrate that a decoupled, hierarchical design can effectively mitigate the internal dynamic disturbances arising from the mass and movement of the SLs, enabling stable locomotion for humanoids equipped with functional limbs.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned policy learning for robotic manipulation presents significant challenges in maintaining performance across diverse objectives and environments. We introduce Hyper-GoalNet, a framework that generates task-specific policy network parameters from goal specifications using hypernetworks. Unlike conventional methods that simply condition fixed networks on goal-state pairs, our approach separates goal interpretation from state processing -- the former determines network parameters while the latter applies these parameters to current observations. To enhance representation quality for effective policy generation, we implement two complementary constraints on the latent space: (1) a forward dynamics model that promotes state transition predictability, and (2) a distance-based constraint ensuring monotonic progression toward goal states. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive suite of manipulation tasks with varying environmental randomization. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-variability conditions. Real-world robotic experiments further validate our method's robustness to sensor noise and physical uncertainties. Code is available at: https://github.com/wantingyao/hyper-goalnet.

Abstract: How do humans recognize and rectify social missteps? We achieve social competence by looking around at our peers, decoding subtle cues from bystanders - a raised eyebrow, a laugh - to evaluate the environment and our actions. Robots, however, struggle to perceive and make use of these nuanced reactions. By employing a novel neck-mounted device that records facial expressions from the chin region, we explore the potential of previously untapped data to capture and interpret human responses to robot error. First, we develop NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model to map the reactions captured through the chin camera onto facial points and head motion. We then use these facial responses to develop a robot error detection model which outperforms standard methodologies such as using OpenFace or video data, generalizing well especially for within-participant data. Through this work, we argue for expanding human-in-the-loop robot sensing, fostering more seamless integration of robots into diverse human environments, pushing the boundaries of social cue detection and opening new avenues for adaptable robotics.

Abstract: Imitation learning provides a promising approach to dexterous hand manipulation, but its effectiveness is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity data. Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations further increases the success rate by an average of 25% over the vision-only baseline, validating the fidelity and utility of the dataset.

Result: 对15名大学生进行评估，系统可用性评分为79.2，整体体验和参与度高。

Conclusion: SAR-based生产力教练可以为大学生提高生产力提供有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: College students often face academic challenges that hamper their productivity and well-being. Although self-help books and productivity apps are popular, they often fall short. Books provide generalized, non-interactive guidance, and apps are not inherently educational and can hinder the development of key organizational skills. Traditional productivity coaching offers personalized support, but is resource-intensive and difficult to scale. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept for a socially assistive robot (SAR) as an educational coach and a potential solution to the limitations of existing productivity tools and coaching approaches. The SAR delivers six different lessons on time management and task prioritization. Users interact via a chat interface, while the SAR responds through speech (with a toggle option). An integrated dashboard monitors progress, mood, engagement, confidence per lesson, and time spent per lesson. It also offers personalized productivity insights to foster reflection and self-awareness. We evaluated the system with 15 college students, achieving a System Usability Score of 79.2 and high ratings for overall experience and engagement. Our findings suggest that SAR-based productivity coaching can offer an effective and scalable solution to improve productivity among college students.

Abstract: College students often face academic and life stressors affecting productivity, especially students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who experience executive functioning challenges. Conventional productivity tools typically demand sustained self-discipline and consistent use, which many students struggle with, leading to disruptive app-switching behaviors. Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), known for their intuitive and interactive nature, offer promising potential to support productivity in academic environments, having been successfully utilized in domains like education, cognitive development, and mental health. To leverage SARs effectively in addressing student productivity, this study employed a Participatory Design (PD) approach, directly involving college students and a Student Success and Well-Being Coach in the design process. Through interviews and a collaborative workshop, we gathered detailed insights on productivity challenges and identified desirable features for a productivity-focused SAR. Importantly, ethical considerations were integrated from the onset, facilitating responsible and user-aligned design choices. Our contributions include comprehensive insights into student productivity challenges, SAR design preferences, and actionable recommendations for effective robot characteristics. Additionally, we present stakeholder-derived ethical guidelines to inform responsible future implementations of productivity-focused SARs in higher education.

Conclusion: DPNet在高精度和高频率的跟踪与规划中优于其他基准方案。

Abstract: Existing motion planning methods often struggle with rapid-motion obstacles due to an insufficient understanding of environmental changes. To address this limitation, we propose integrating motion planners with Doppler LiDARs which provide not only ranging measurements but also instantaneous point velocities. However, this integration is nontrivial due to the dual requirements of high accuracy and high frequency. To this end, we introduce Doppler Planning Network (DPNet), which tracks and reacts to rapid obstacles using Doppler model-based learning. Particularly, we first propose a Doppler Kalman neural network (D-KalmanNet) to track the future states of obstacles under partially observable Gaussian state space model. We then leverage the estimated motions to construct a Doppler-tuned model predictive control (DT-MPC) framework for ego-motion planning, enabling runtime auto-tuning of the controller parameters. These two model-based learners allow DPNet to maintain lightweight while learning fast environmental changes using minimum data, and achieve both high frequency and high accuracy in tracking and planning. Experiments on both high-fidelity simulator and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DPNet over extensive benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Multi-UAV cooperative path planning (MUCPP) is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, aiming to generate collision-free trajectories for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to complete distributed tasks efficiently. A key challenge lies in achieving both efficiency, by minimizing total mission cost, and fairness, by balancing the workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents. This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. For each UAV, collision-free trajectories are generated using A* search over a terrain-aware configuration space. Comprehensive experiments on multiple terrain datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior trade-offs between total distance and makespan compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Robotic continuous control tasks impose stringent demands on the energy efficiency and latency of computing architectures due to their high-dimensional state spaces and real-time interaction requirements. Conventional electronic computing platforms face computational bottlenecks, whereas the fusion of photonic computing and spiking reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. Here, we propose a novel computing architecture based on photonic spiking RL, which integrates the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm with spiking neural network (SNN). The proposed architecture employs an optical-electronic hybrid computing paradigm wherein a silicon photonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) chip executes linear matrix computations, while nonlinear spiking activations are performed in the electronic domain. Experimental validation on the Pendulum-v1 and HalfCheetah-v2 benchmarks demonstrates the system capability for software-hardware co-inference, achieving a control policy reward of 5831 on HalfCheetah-v2, a 23.33% reduction in convergence steps, and an action deviation below 2.2%. Notably, this work represents the first application of a programmable MZI photonic computing chip to robotic continuous control tasks, attaining an energy efficiency of 1.39 TOPS/W and an ultralow computational latency of 120 ps. Such performance underscores the promise of photonic spiking RL for real-time decision-making in autonomous and industrial robotic systems.

TL;DR: CRSAIL通过有效的状态查询策略减少专家查询，提升了主动模仿学习的效率，并在多种任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对主动模仿学习中由于专家行动标记带来的高成本，特别是在GPU密集型模拟器和人机协作情况下，提出了一种高效的查询方法。

Method: 提出了一种被称为CRSAIL的查询规则，依据与第K个最近专家状态的距离来评估状态的新颖性，并通过符合预测设定全球阈值，以决定何时查询专家的动作。

Result: 在MuJoCo机器人任务上，CRSAIL的表现与专家级别的奖励相当或超出，同时对比DAgger方法和以往的AIL方法分别减少了最多96%和65%的专家查询次数。

Conclusion: CRSAIL通过减少对专家的查询次数，在保持或超过专家级别的奖励的同时，增强了主动模仿学习的有效性，适用于动态未知的新系统。

Abstract: Active imitation learning (AIL) combats covariate shift by querying an expert during training. However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction. This threshold is the empirical $(1-α)$ quantile of on-policy calibration scores, providing a distribution-free calibration rule that links $α$ to the expected query rate and makes $α$ a task-agnostic tuning knob. This state-space querying strategy is robust to outliers and, unlike safety-gate-based AIL, can be run without real-time expert takeovers: we roll out full trajectories (episodes) with the learner and only afterward query the expert on a subset of visited states. Evaluated on MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches or exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and up to 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with empirical robustness to $α$ and $K$, easing deployment on novel systems with unknown dynamics.

Method: 提出了一种在VAE学习的潜在空间中进行规划的框架，利用细粒度特征蒸馏机制来优化高层语义与场景背景的融合。

Result: 在大规模nuPlan基准上，通过单次去噪步骤生成高质量计划，大幅度降低计算开销。

Conclusion: LAP在学习型规划方法中实现了先进的闭环性能，并提供了最高10倍的推理速度提升。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities for modeling human-like driving behaviors in autonomous driving, but their iterative sampling process induces substantial latency, and operating directly on raw trajectory points forces the model to spend capacity on low-level kinematics, rather than high-level multi-modal semantics. To address these limitations, we propose LAtent Planner (LAP), a framework that plans in a VAE-learned latent space that disentangles high-level intents from low-level kinematics, enabling our planner to capture rich, multi-modal driving strategies. We further introduce a fine-grained feature distillation mechanism to guide a better interaction and fusion between the high-level semantic planning space and the vectorized scene context. Notably, LAP can produce high-quality plans in one single denoising step, substantially reducing computational overhead. Through extensive evaluations on the large-scale nuPlan benchmark, LAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance among learning-based planning methods, while demonstrating an inference speed-up of at most 10 times over previous SOTA approaches.

Conclusion: 提出的层次导航框架在不确定性下实现了安全导航，适用于多种机器人平台。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in partially observable environments requires agents to reason beyond immediate sensor input, exploit occlusion, and ensure safety while progressing toward a goal. These challenges arise in many robotics domains, from urban driving and warehouse automation to defense and surveillance. Classical path planning approaches and memoryless reinforcement learning often fail under limited fields of view (FoVs) and occlusions, committing to unsafe or inefficient maneuvers. We propose a hierarchical navigation framework that integrates a Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) as a high-level subgoal selector with a modular low-level controller for waypoint execution. The DTQN consumes short histories of task-aware features, encoding odometry, goal direction, obstacle proximity, and visibility cues, and outputs Q-values to rank candidate subgoals. Visibility-aware candidate generation introduces masking and exposure penalties, rewarding the use of cover and anticipatory safety. A low-level potential field controller then tracks the selected subgoal, ensuring smooth short-horizon obstacle avoidance. We validate our approach in 2D simulation and extend it directly to a 3D Unity-ROS environment by projecting point-cloud perception into the same feature schema, enabling transfer without architectural changes. Results show consistent improvements over classical planners and RL baselines in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal, with ablations confirming the value of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design. These findings highlight a generalizable framework for safe navigation under uncertainty, with broad relevance across robotic platforms.

Motivation: 在校准和配准任务中，由于缺失的时间对齐、异常值和未知的轴约定，旋转集的对应关系常常受到干扰。

Conclusion: 该方法在没有对应搜索的情况下，能够有效处理极端的异常值，且计算速度比传统方法快6到60倍。

Abstract: We address the correspondence-free alignment of two rotation sets on \(SO(3)\), a core task in calibration and registration that is often impeded by missing time alignment, outliers, and unknown axis conventions. Our key idea is to decompose each rotation into its \emph{Transformed Basis Vectors} (TBVs)-three unit vectors on \(S^2\)-and align the resulting spherical point sets per axis using fast, robust matchers (SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid). To handle axis relabels and sign flips, we introduce a \emph{Permutation-and-Sign Invariant} (PASI) wrapper that enumerates the 24 proper signed permutations, scores them via summed correlations, and fuses the per-axis estimates into a single rotation by projection/Karcher mean. The overall complexity remains linear in the number of rotations (\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)), contrasting with \(\mathcal{O}(N_r^3\log N_r)\) for spherical/\(SO(3)\) correlation. Experiments on EuRoC Machine Hall simulations
  (axis-consistent) and the ETH Hand-Eye benchmark (\texttt{robot\_arm\_real})
  (axis-ambiguous) show that our methods are accurate, 6-60x faster than traditional methods, and robust under extreme outlier ratios (up to 90\%), all without correspondence search.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently enabled impressive locomotion capabilities on legged robots; however, most policy architectures remain morphology- and symmetry-agnostic, leading to inefficient training and limited generalization. This work introduces MS-PPO, a morphological-symmetry-equivariant policy learning framework that encodes robot kinematic structure and morphological symmetries directly into the policy network. We construct a morphology-informed graph neural architecture that is provably equivariant with respect to the robot's morphological symmetry group actions, ensuring consistent policy responses under symmetric states while maintaining invariance in value estimation. This design eliminates the need for tedious reward shaping or costly data augmentation, which are typically required to enforce symmetry. We evaluate MS-PPO in simulation on Unitree Go2 and Xiaomi CyberDog2 robots across diverse locomotion tasks, including trotting, pronking, slope walking, and bipedal turning, and further deploy the learned policies on hardware. Extensive experiments show that MS-PPO achieves superior training stability, symmetry generalization ability, and sample efficiency in challenging locomotion tasks, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These findings demonstrate that embedding both kinematic structure and morphological symmetry into policy learning provides a powerful inductive bias for legged robot locomotion control.

Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) provides a rigorous framework for complex robotic tasks, yet existing methods often rely on accurate dynamics models or expensive online interactions. In this work, we address LTL-constrained control in a challenging offline, model-free setting, utilizing only fixed, task-agnostic datasets of fragmented trajectories. We propose SAGAS, a novel framework combining graph-assisted trajectory stitching with automata-guided planning. First, we construct a latent reachability graph from a learned temporal-distance representation. To bridge the semantic gap, we augment this graph with certified anchor nodes and probabilistic soft labels. We then translate the specification into a Büchi automaton and search the implicit product space to derive a cost-minimal prefix-suffix plan. Finally, a subgoal-conditioned low-level policy is deployed to execute these latent waypoints. Experiments on OGBench locomotion domains demonstrate that SAGAS successfully synthesizes efficient trajectories for diverse LTL tasks, effectively bridging the gap between fragmented offline data and complex logical constraints.

Conclusion: BRC-based手语识别系统适用于边缘设备，具有竞争力的准确性和显著较低的训练时间。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) facilitates communication between deaf and hearing individuals. Deep learning is widely used to develop SLR-based systems; however, it is computationally intensive and requires substantial computational resources, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. To address this, we propose an efficient sign language recognition system using MediaPipe and an echo state network (ESN)-based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) architecture. MediaPipe extracts hand joint coordinates, which serve as inputs to the ESN-based BRC architecture. The BRC processes these features in both forward and backward directions, efficiently capturing temporal dependencies. The resulting states of BRC are concatenated to form a robust representation for classification. We evaluated our method on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving a competitive accuracy of 57.71% and a significantly lower training time of only 9 seconds, in contrast to the 55 minutes and $38$ seconds required by the deep learning-based Bi-GRU approach. Consequently, the BRC-based SLR system is well-suited for edge devices.

Conclusion: 使用InteractGen框架，通过多智能体的协调，证明了在社会化服务自主性方面比单一模型更具可行性。

Abstract: Foundation models have become central to unifying perception and planning in robotics, yet real-world deployment exposes a mismatch between their monolithic assumption that a single model can handle all cognitive functions and the distributed, dynamic nature of practical service workflows. Vision-language models offer strong semantic understanding but lack embodiment-aware action capabilities while relying on hand-crafted skills. Vision-Language-Action policies enable reactive manipulation but remain brittle across embodiments, weak in geometric grounding, and devoid of proactive collaboration mechanisms. These limitations indicate that scaling a single model alone cannot deliver reliable autonomy for service robots operating in human-populated settings. To address this gap, we present InteractGen, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents for continuous perception, dependency-aware planning, decision and verification, failure reflection, and dynamic human delegation, treating foundation models as regulated components within a closed-loop collective. Deployed on a heterogeneous robot team and evaluated in a three-month open-use study, InteractGen improves task success, adaptability, and human-robot collaboration, providing evidence that multi-agent orchestration offers a more feasible path toward socially grounded service autonomy than further scaling standalone models.

Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and fault-tolerant framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission management in complex and uncertain environments. The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time without sacrificing mission reliability or policy optimality. The proposed framework establishes a practical and robust foundation for scalable decision-making in real-time UAV mission execution.

Abstract: Soft robots are powerful tools for manipulating delicate objects, yet their adoption is hindered by two gaps: the lack of integrated tactile sensing and sensor signal distortion caused by actuator deformations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the SoftMag actuator: a magnetic tactile-sensorized soft actuator. Unlike systems relying on attached sensors or treating sensing and actuation separately, SoftMag unifies them through a shared architecture while confronting the mechanical parasitic effect, where deformations corrupt tactile signals. A multiphysics simulation framework models this coupling, and a neural-network-based decoupling strategy removes the parasitic component, restoring sensing fidelity. Experiments including indentation, quasi-static and step actuation, and fatigue tests validate the actuator's performance and decoupling effectiveness. Building upon this foundation, the system is extended into a two-finger SoftMag gripper, where a multi-task neural network enables real-time prediction of tri-axial contact forces and position. Furthermore, a probing-based strategy estimates object firmness during grasping. Validation on apricots shows a strong correlation (Pearson r over 0.8) between gripper-estimated firmness and reference measurements, confirming the system's capability for non-destructive quality assessment. Results demonstrate that combining integrated magnetic sensing, learning-based correction, and real-time inference enables a soft robotic platform that adapts its grasp and quantifies material properties. The framework offers an approach for advancing sensorized soft actuators toward intelligent, material-aware robotics.

Conclusion: B-CTMP算法在半结构化环境中提供了速度和成功的可证明保证，统一了无碰撞规划和物体操作。

Abstract: Recent progress in contact-rich robotic manipulation has been striking, yet most deployed systems remain confined to simple, scripted routines. One of the key barriers is the lack of motion planning algorithms that can provide verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency and reliability. To address this, a family of algorithms called Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) was introduced, which leverages a preprocessing phase to enable collision-free motion queries in a fixed, user-specified time budget (e.g., 10 milliseconds). However, existing CTMP methods do not explicitly incorporate the manipulation behaviors essential for object handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textit{Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner} (B-CTMP), an algorithm that extends CTMP to solve a broad class of two-step manipulation tasks: (1) a collision-free motion to a behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of a manipulation behavior (such as grasping or insertion) to reach the goal. By precomputing compact data structures, B-CTMP guarantees constant-time query in mere milliseconds while ensuring completeness and successful task execution over a specified set of states. We evaluate B-CTMP on two canonical manipulation tasks in simulation, shelf picking and plug insertion,and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real robot. Our results show that B-CTMP unifies collision-free planning and object manipulation within a single constant-time framework, providing provable guarantees of speed and success for manipulation in semi-structured environments.

Method: 引入H-Zero，一个跨人形机器人运动的预训练管道，学习一种可泛化的人形机器人基础策略。

Result: 通过在有限的模型上进行预训练，H-Zero可在新的人形机器人上实现高达81%的全剧集持续时间，同时在30分钟内实现对未见人形的少量微调。

Conclusion: H-Zero能够有效地在未知的人形机器人上实现零-shot和少-shot转移，显示其通用性和适应性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of humanoid robotics has intensified the need for robust and adaptable controllers to enable stable and efficient locomotion across diverse platforms. However, developing such controllers remains a significant challenge because existing solutions are tailored to specific robot designs, requiring extensive tuning of reward functions, physical parameters, and training hyperparameters for each embodiment. To address this challenge, we introduce H-Zero, a cross-humanoid locomotion pretraining pipeline that learns a generalizable humanoid base policy. We show that pretraining on a limited set of embodiments enables zero-shot and few-shot transfer to novel humanoid robots with minimal fine-tuning. Evaluations show that the pretrained policy maintains up to 81% of the full episode duration on unseen robots in simulation while enabling few-shot transfer to unseen humanoids and upright quadrupeds within 30 minutes of fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Object Goal Navigation problem, where a robot must efficiently find a target object in an unknown environment. Existing implicit memory-based methods struggle with long-term memory retention and planning, while explicit map-based approaches lack rich semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose FOM-Nav, a modular framework that enhances exploration efficiency through Frontier-Object Maps and vision-language models. Our Frontier-Object Maps are built online and jointly encode spatial frontiers and fine-grained object information. Using this representation, a vision-language model performs multimodal scene understanding and high-level goal prediction, which is executed by a low-level planner for efficient trajectory generation. To train FOM-Nav, we automatically construct large-scale navigation datasets from real-world scanned environments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model design and constructed dataset. FOM-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MP3D and HM3D benchmarks, particularly in navigation efficiency metric SPL, and yields promising results on a real robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉摄像头和激光雷达在能见度差的环境中表现不佳，而UWB雷达提供了一种有效替代方案。

Method: 使用超宽带(UWB)雷达构建无基础设施的障碍物检测和环境地图，包含目标识别、过滤和聚类三个步骤。

Result: 提出的方法成功减少了噪声和多径效应，提高了障碍物检测的精确度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法在探测低反射材料（如胶合板）时，成功实现了至少82.36%的精确度和89.46%的召回率，且不依赖于固定的锚节点。

Abstract: This paper presents an infrastructure-free approach for obstacle detection and environmental mapping using ultra-wideband (UWB) radar mounted on a mobile robotic platform. Traditional sensing modalities such as visual cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) fail in environments with poor visibility due to darkness, smoke, or reflective surfaces. In these visioned-impaired conditions, UWB radar offers a promising alternative. To this end, this work explores the suitability of robot-mounted UWB radar for environmental mapping in dynamic, anchor-free scenarios. The study investigates how different materials (metal, concrete and plywood) and UWB radio channels (5 and 9) influence the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). Furthermore, a processing pipeline is proposed to achieve reliable mapping of detected obstacles, consisting of 3 steps: (i) target identification (based on CIR peak detection), (ii) filtering (based on peak properties, signal-to-noise score, and phase-difference of arrival), and (iii) clustering (based on distance estimation and angle-of-arrival estimation). The proposed approach successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, resulting in an obstacle detection precision of at least 82.36% and a recall of 89.46% on channel 9 even when detecting low-reflective materials such as plywood. This work offers a foundation for further development of UWB-based localisation and mapping (SLAM) systems that do not rely on visual features and, unlike conventional UWB localisation systems, do not require on fixed anchor nodes for triangulation.

Conclusion: 我们的CycleManip框架在循环基础任务操作中实现了高成功率，并显示出在通用操作中的适应性和即插即用的能力，可以应用于多种机器人平台。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet underexplored task in robot manipulation: cycle-based manipulation, where robots need to perform cyclic or repetitive actions with an expected terminal time. These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Moreover, the results show that our approach can be applied across diverse robotic platforms, including bi-arm grippers, dexterous hands, and humanoid robots.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言行动模型在实际应用中的响应速度慢，且往往因为动作不稳定而影响精度，急需提高实时性和准确性以适应复杂的机器人任务。

Method: 提出了一种新的异步推理框架VLASH，通过预测未来的执行状态来消除预测与执行之间的时间错位，提高机器人在动态环境中的反应能力。

Result: VLASH将反应延迟减少至17.4倍，速度提升至2.03倍，相比于同步推理，维持了原有的准确性，能够有效应对快速反应的精确任务。

Conclusion: VLASH显著提高了视觉语言行动模型的反应速度和精度，解决了传统方法的局限性，使其能够处理高速、高精度的任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are increasingly used in various applications due to their high mobility and ability to operate in diverse terrains. However, most available quadruped robots are primarily focused on mobility without object manipulation capabilities. Equipping a quadruped robot with a robotic arm and gripper introduces a challenge in manual control, especially in remote scenarios that require complex commands. This research aims to develop an autonomous grasping system on a quadruped robot using a task-level interaction approach. The system includes hardware integration of a robotic arm and gripper onto the quadruped robot's body, a layered control system designed using ROS, and a web-based interface for human-robot interaction. The robot is capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigation, object detection, and grasping using GraspNet. Testing was conducted through real-world scenarios to evaluate navigation, object selection and grasping, and user experience. The results show that the robot can perform tasks accurately and consistently, achieving a grasping success rate of 75 % from 12 trials. Therefore, the system demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the capabilities of quadruped robots as service robots in real-world environments.

Abstract: Recent progress in GPU-accelerated, photorealistic simulation has opened a scalable data-generation path for robot learning, where massive physics and visual randomization allow policies to generalize beyond curated environments. Building on these advances, we develop a teacher-student-bootstrap learning framework for vision-based humanoid loco-manipulation, using articulated-object interaction as a representative high-difficulty benchmark. Our approach introduces a staged-reset exploration strategy that stabilizes long-horizon privileged-policy training, and a GRPO-based fine-tuning procedure that mitigates partial observability and improves closed-loop consistency in sim-to-real RL. Trained entirely on simulation data, the resulting policy achieves robust zero-shot performance across diverse door types and outperforms human teleoperators by up to 31.7% in task completion time under the same whole-body control stack. This represents the first humanoid sim-to-real policy capable of diverse articulated loco-manipulation using pure RGB perception.

Conclusion: 通过在六自由度工业臂上测试该框架，验证了其在拦截任务中的有效性，认为该方法能够有效处理传感器噪声和目标状态的不确定性。

Abstract: Intercepting fast moving objects, by its very nature, is challenging because of its tight time constraints. This problem becomes further complicated in the presence of sensor noise because noisy sensors provide, at best, incomplete information, which results in a distribution over target states to be intercepted. Since time is of the essence, to hit the target, the planner must begin directing the interceptor, in this case a robot arm, while still receiving information. We introduce an tree-like structure, which is grown using kinodynamic motion primitives in state-time space. This tree-like structure encodes reachability to multiple goals from a single origin, while enabling real-time value updates as the target belief evolves and seamless transitions between goals. We evaluate our framework on an interception task on a 6 DOF industrial arm (ABB IRB-1600) with an onboard stereo camera (ZED 2i). A robust Innovation-based Adaptive Estimation Adaptive Kalman Filter (RIAE-AKF) is used to track the target and perform belief updates.

Motivation: 由于机器人的瞬时感知观察未必能揭示任务相关的状态信息，在这类部分可观察的情况下，优化行为通常需要明确地采取行动以获取缺失的信息，当前的学习技术难以应对。

Conclusion: AAWR展现了在部分可观察任务中，机器人可以通过积极感知行为得到有效提升，能够在多个操作任务中超越以往的方法。

Abstract: A robot's instantaneous sensory observations do not always reveal task-relevant state information. Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to "privileged" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a "generalist" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Coaxial bi-copter autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) have garnered attention due to their potential for improved rotor system efficiency and compact form factor. However, balancing efficiency, maneuverability, and compactness in coaxial bi-copter systems remains a key design challenge, limiting their practical deployment. This letter introduces COMET, a coaxial bi-copter AAV platform featuring a dual swashplate mechanism. The coaxial bi-copter system's efficiency and compactness are optimized through bench tests, and the whole prototype's efficiency and robustness under varying payload conditions are verified through flight endurance experiments. The maneuverability performance of the system is evaluated in comprehensive trajectory tracking tests. The results indicate that the dual swashplate configuration enhances tracking performance and improves flight efficiency compared to the single swashplate alternative. Successful autonomous flight trials across various scenarios verify COMET's potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial tracking with drones offers vast potential for surveillance, cinematography, and industrial inspection applications. While single-drone tracking systems have been extensively studied, swarm-based target tracking remains underexplored, despite its unique advantages of distributed perception, fault-tolerant redundancy, and multidirectional target coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel decentralized LiDAR-based swarm tracking framework that enables visibility-aware, cooperative target tracking in complex environments, while fully harnessing the unique capabilities of swarm systems. To address visibility, we introduce a novel Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF)-based metric for 3-D environmental occlusion representation, coupled with an efficient algorithm that enables real-time onboard SSDF updating. A general Field-of-View (FOV) alignment cost supporting heterogeneous LiDAR configurations is proposed for consistent target observation. Swarm coordination is enhanced through cooperative costs that enforce inter-robot safe clearance, prevent mutual occlusions, and notably facilitate 3-D multidirectional target encirclement via a novel electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical planner, combining a kinodynamic front-end searcher with a spatiotemporal $SE(3)$ back-end optimizer to generate collision-free, visibility-optimized trajectories.Deployed on heterogeneous LiDAR swarms, our fully decentralized implementation features collaborative perception, distributed planning, and dynamic swarm reconfigurability. Validated through rigorous real-world experiments in cluttered outdoor environments, the proposed system demonstrates robust cooperative tracking of agile targets (drones, humans) while achieving superior visibility maintenance.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have received significant research interests and advancements in recent years. Despite many successes, due to their morphology, dynamics and limitation of control policy, humanoid robots are prone to fall as compared to other embodiments like quadruped or wheeled robots. And its large weight, tall Center of Mass, high Degree-of-Freedom would cause serious hardware damages when falling uncontrolled, to both itself and surrounding objects. Existing researches in this field mostly focus on using control based methods that struggle to cater diverse falling scenarios and may introduce unsuitable human prior. On the other hand, large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning could be employed to incentivize humanoid agent discovering falling protection policy that fits its own nature and property. In this work, with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum, we successfully train humanoid agent to explore falling protection behaviors and discover that by forming a `triangle' structure, the falling damages could be significantly reduced with its rigid-material body. With comprehensive metrics and experiments, we quantify its performance with comparison to other methods, visualize its falling behaviors and successfully transfer it to real world platform.

Motivation: 机器人技术需要适应不同的人形身体结构，因此开发一种适应性强的微调框架是必要的。

Method: 通过引入后处理模态（如二进制接触信号和深度图）以及新颖的多模态数据集，对两个不同的人形机器人平台进行验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过模态增强的策略在不同的机器人模型中表现显著提升，特别是在GR1和Unitree G1模型上。

Conclusion: 该研究提出一种轻量级的数据增强方法，通过目标模态设计和多模态微调来改进基础机器人策略，适应不同的人形机器人平台。

Abstract: This paper presents a modality-augmented fine-tuning framework designed to adapt foundation robot policies to diverse humanoid embodiments. We validate our approach across two distinct settings: (i) the GR1 embodiment, utilizing public datasets where we introduce post-processed modalities, including binary contact signals and ZoeDepth-generated metric depth; and (ii) the Unitree G1 embodiment, for which we contribute a novel multi-modal dataset incorporating cuRobo motion planning, inverse kinematics, and ground-truth contact-force measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that modality augmentation consistently enhances policy performance across different embodiments. Specifically, for the GR1, integrating contact-state cues and RGB-D fusion improves online success rates from 51% to 63%. Furthermore, in the G1 "Pick Apple to Bowl" task, our contact-augmented model achieves a success rate of 94%, significantly outperforming the 48% achieved by standard fine-tuning and the 0% baseline of zero-shot transfer. These results highlight that lightweight post-processing effectively strengthens policies for GR1, while high-quality multi-modal data is crucial for reliable transfer to the Unitree G1. Consequently, this work establishes a unified, data-centric pathway for extending foundation robot policies through targeted modality design and multi-modal fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出可变材料操控增强(M$^3$A)框架，利用光度重渲染生成多样化的操控演示，有效提高机器人在不同材料物体上的操控能力，实验结果表明成功率提高58.03%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对透明或反射表面材料的物体进行操控时，现有的方法受到视觉域差距或大量真实演示成本的限制，因此需要一种新的方法来提高材料泛化能力。

Method: 引入可变材料操控增强(M$^3$A)，通过光传输捕捉材料的物理特性进行光度重渲染，从而生成多样化的高真实感演示。

Result: 通过在单一的现实世界演示的基础上，通过光度重渲染生成不同材料属性的多样化演示，从而有效解耦任务特定的操控技能与表面外观。

Conclusion: M$^3$A框架显著提高了跨材料的泛化能力，在三个现实世界任务中的平均成功率提高了58.03%。

Abstract: Material generalization is essential for real-world robotic manipulation, where robots must interact with objects exhibiting diverse visual and physical properties. This challenge is particularly pronounced for objects made of glass, metal, or other materials whose transparent or reflective surfaces introduce severe out-of-distribution variations. Existing approaches either rely on simulated materials in simulators and perform sim-to-real transfer, which is hindered by substantial visual domain gaps, or depend on collecting extensive real-world demonstrations, which is costly, time-consuming, and still insufficient to cover various materials. To overcome these limitations, we resort to computational photography and introduce Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), a unified framework that leverages the physical characteristics of materials as captured by light transport for photometric re-rendering. The core idea is simple yet powerful: given a single real-world demonstration, we photometrically re-render the scene to generate a diverse set of highly realistic demonstrations with different material properties. This augmentation effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling policies to generalize across materials without additional data collection. To systematically evaluate this capability, we construct the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark spanning both simulation and real-world environments. Extensive experiments show that the M$^3$A policy significantly enhances cross-material generalization, improving the average success rate across three real-world tasks by 58.03\%, and demonstrating robust performance on previously unseen materials.

Abstract: Embodied navigation for long-horizon tasks, guided by complex natural language instructions, remains a formidable challenge in artificial intelligence. Existing agents often struggle with robust long-term planning about unseen environments, leading to high failure rates. To address these limitations, we introduce NavForesee, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) that unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination within a single, unified framework. Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones. The VLM's structured plan guides its targeted prediction, while the imagined future provides rich context to inform the navigation actions, creating a powerful internal feedback loop of perception-planning/prediction-action. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmark that NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance in complex scenarios. Our work highlights the immense potential of fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction, paving the way for more intelligent and capable embodied agents.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion enables robust environmental perception by leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous sensing modalities. However, accurate calibration is a critical prerequisite for effective fusion. This paper proposes a novel one-key calibration framework named L2M-Calib for a fused magnetic-LiDAR system, jointly estimating the extrinsic transformation between the two kinds of sensors and the intrinsic distortion parameters of the magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field (AMF) patterns, which are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them suitable for challenging environments. Nonetheless, the integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems remains underexplored due to the absence of effective calibration techniques. To address this, we optimize extrinsic parameters using an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme, coupled with the intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem, ensuring robustness against measurement noise and ill-conditioned data. Extensive evaluations on both simulated datasets and real-world experiments, including AGV-mounted sensor configurations, demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy and robustness under various environmental and operational conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未考虑跨平台可迁移性和能效，现代移动和航空操控对这些能力需求日益增强。

Method: 引入交叉表现夹持基准（CEGB），扩展现有YCB和NIST指标，增加三个新组件：传输时间基准、能量消耗基准、意图特定理想载荷评估。

Result: CEGB能够有效测量夹持表现和在异构机器人系统中重用单个夹持器的适用性。

Conclusion: CEGB为无人机和操纵器领域的夹持器提供了一种可重复的评估基础。

Abstract: Robotic grippers are increasingly deployed across industrial, collaborative, and aerial platforms, where each embodiment imposes distinct mechanical, energetic, and operational constraints. Established YCB and NIST benchmarks quantify grasp success, force, or timing on a single platform, but do not evaluate cross-embodiment transferability or energy-aware performance, capabilities essential for modern mobile and aerial manipulation. This letter introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), a compact and reproducible benchmarking suite extending YCB and selected NIST metrics with three additional components: a transfer-time benchmark measuring the practical effort required to exchange embodiments, an energy-consumption benchmark evaluating grasping and holding efficiency, and an intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent operational capability. Together, these metrics characterize both grasp performance and the suitability of reusing a single gripper across heterogeneous robotic systems. A lightweight self-locking gripper prototype is implemented as a reference case. Experiments demonstrate rapid embodiment transfer (median ~= 17.6 s across user groups), low holding energy for gripper prototype (~= 1.5 J per 10 s), and consistent grasp performance with cycle times of 3.2 - 3.9 s and success rates exceeding 90%. CEGB thus provides a reproducible foundation for cross-platform, energy-aware evaluation of grippers in aerial and manipulators domains.

Abstract: This work presents a real-time autonomous track navigation framework for nonholonomic differential-drive mobile robots by jointly integrating multi-task visual perception and a provably stable tracking controller. The perception pipeline reconstructs lane centerlines using 2D-to-3D camera projection, arc-length based uniform point resampling, and cubic polynomial fitting solved via robust QR least-squares optimization. The controller regulates robot linear and angular velocities through a Lyapunov-stability grounded design, ensuring bounded error dynamics and asymptotic convergence of position and heading deviations even in dynamic and partially perceived lane scenarios, without relying on HD prior maps or global satellite localization. Real-world experiments on embedded platforms verify system fidelity, real-time execution, trajectory smoothness, and closed-loop stability for reliable autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as efficient tools to address the safe navigation problem for robot applications. However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods.

Result: DiG-Flow通过计算观测和动作嵌入的分布差异度量，对观测嵌入进行残差更新，从而提高模型性能，特别是在复杂多步骤任务和有限训练数据下表现显著改善

Conclusion: 在不修改流匹配路径或目标向量场的情况下，DiG-Flow可有效提升VLA的表现，并提供了理论保障和实证支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.

Abstract: Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

Conclusion: IGen能够支持从开放世界图像生成可扩展的数据，为通用机器人策略训练提供帮助。

Abstract: The rise of generalist robotic policies has created an exponential demand for large-scale training data. However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training.

Conclusion: GR-RL 是首个能够自主完成复杂精细操作的学习型策略，成功率达到 83.3%。

Abstract: We present GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that turns a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) policy into a highly capable specialist for long-horizon dexterous manipulation. Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.

Motivation: 探究生成模型在机器人控制中成功的因素，尤其是它们在行为克隆中的表现。

Method: 在常见的行为克隆基准上对流和扩散等流行的生成控制策略（GCPs）进行全面评估。

Result: 最小迭代策略（MIP）在性能上与流GCPs相匹配，并且通常优于提炼短路模型，表明GCP的分布拟合部分不如预期重要。

Conclusion: GCP的优势主要来源于迭代计算，而非其捕捉多模态或表达复杂行为的能力。

Abstract: Generative models, like flows and diffusions, have recently emerged as popular and efficacious policy parameterizations in robotics. There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

To assess this, we perform grasping trials in a physics-based simulator, using image-based pose estimates to guide a parallel gripper and an underactuated robotic hand in picking up 3D models of objects. Our experiments on a subset of the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) dataset compare five open-source object pose estimators and provide insights that were missing from the literature.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了NeuroHJR在拥挤环境中进行障碍物规避的有效性，提供了一种新的可实时、可扩展的解决方案，具有与经典HJR求解器相当的安全性能，但计算成本显著降低。

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) must navigate safely in cluttered environments while accounting for complex dynamics and environmental uncertainty. Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) offers formal safety guarantees through the computation of forward and backward reachable sets, but its application is hindered by poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles. In this paper, we present a novel framework called NeuroHJR that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the HJR solution for real-time obstacle avoidance. By embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, our method bypasses the need for grid-based discretization and enables efficient estimation of reachable sets in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios, showing that it achieves safety performance comparable to that of classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing the computational cost. This work provides a new step toward real-time, scalable deployment of reachability-based obstacle avoidance in robotics.

Abstract: Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.

Conclusion: Guardian有效地提高了任务成功率，并在新引入的基准测试中取得了领先表现，显示了生成失败数据的影响。

Abstract: Robust robotic manipulation requires reliable failure detection and recovery. Although current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their accuracy and generalization are limited by the scarcity of failure data. To address this data gap, we propose an automatic robot failure synthesis approach that procedurally perturbs successful trajectories to generate diverse planning and execution failures. This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks. It also effectively improves task success rates when integrated into a state-of-the-art manipulation system in simulation and real robots, demonstrating the impact of our generated failure data.

Abstract: Autonomous driving policies are typically trained via open-loop behavior cloning of human demonstrations. However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\% and reduces collisions by 54\%.

Abstract: Massively parallel simulation has reduced reinforcement learning (RL) training time for robots from days to minutes. However, achieving fast and reliable sim-to-real RL for humanoid control remains difficult due to the challenges introduced by factors such as high dimensionality and domain randomization. In this work, we introduce a simple and practical recipe based on off-policy RL algorithms, i.e., FastSAC and FastTD3, that enables rapid training of humanoid locomotion policies in just 15 minutes with a single RTX 4090 GPU. Our simple recipe stabilizes off-policy RL algorithms at massive scale with thousands of parallel environments through carefully tuned design choices and minimalist reward functions. We demonstrate rapid end-to-end learning of humanoid locomotion controllers on Unitree G1 and Booster T1 robots under strong domain randomization, e.g., randomized dynamics, rough terrain, and push perturbations, as well as fast training of whole-body human-motion tracking policies.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their promising capabilities of generating robot operation code to enable LLM-driven robots. To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating se- mantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer have made significant progress in dexterous manipulation. However, progress remains limited by the difficulty of simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, especially tactile feedback. In this work, we propose \ours, a sim-to-real framework that addresses these limitations and demonstrates its effectiveness on nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving with multi-fingered hands. The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.
