In many settings common to human-robot interaction, however, the world is only partially observable to the robot, requiring that it create plans under uncertainty. Although many probabilistic planning algorithms exist for this purpose, these algorithms can be inefficient if executed with the robot's limited computational resources, or may require more steps than expected to achieve the goal. We thereby created a new, lightweight, probabilistic planning algorithm, Plan-Orchestrated Tree Assembly for Lookahead (POrTAL), that combines the strengths of two baseline planning algorithms, FF-Replan and POMCP. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate POrTAL's ability to quickly arrive at solutions that outperform these baselines in terms of number of steps. We additionally demonstrate how POrTAL performs under varying temporal constraints."}

Although these SDLs have automated many of the steps required to conduct chemical and materials experiments, a commonly overlooked step in the automation pipeline is the handling and reloading of substrates used to transfer or deposit materials onto for downstream characterization. Here, we develop a closed-loop method of Automated Substrate Handling and Exchange (ASHE) using robotics, dual-actuated dispensers, and deep learning-driven computer vision to detect and correct errors in the manipulation of fragile and transparent substrates for SDLs. Using ASHE, we demonstrate a 98.5% first-time placement accuracy across 130 independent trials of reloading transparent glass substrates into an SDL, where only two substrate misplacements occurred and were successfully detected as errors and automatically corrected. Through the development of more accurate and reliable methods for handling various types of substrates, we move toward an improvement in the automation capabilities of self-driving laboratories, furthering the acceleration of novel chemical and materials discoveries."}

In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon."}

All personalized modalities strengthened Future Self-Continuity (FSC), emotional well-being, and motivation compared to control, with avatar producing the largest vividness gains, yet with no significant differences between formats.

We evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of each approximation method and demonstrate how CSPEZ constraints can be integrated into a trajectory-optimization algorithm to produce safe paths that explicitly account for pursuer uncertainty."}

To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive human study involving interviews with 26 guide dog handlers, four white cane users, nine guide dog trainers, and one O\\&M trainer, along with 15+ hours of observing guide dog-assisted walking. After de-identification, we open-sourced the dataset to promote human-centered development and informed decision-making for assistive systems for BLV people. Building on insights from this formative study, we developed GuideNav, a vision-only, teach-and-repeat navigation system. Inspired by how guide dogs are trained and assist their handlers, GuideNav autonomously repeats a path demonstrated by a sighted person using a robot. Specifically, the system constructs a topological representation of the taught route, integrates visual place recognition with temporal filtering, and employs a relative pose estimator to compute navigation actions - all without relying on costly, heavy, power-hungry sensors such as LiDAR. In field tests, GuideNav consistently achieved kilometer-scale route following across five outdoor environments, maintaining reliability despite noticeable scene variations between teach and repeat runs. A user study with 3 guide dog handlers and 1 guide dog trainer further confirmed the system's feasibility, marking (to our knowledge) the first demonstration of a quadruped mobile system retrieving a path in a manner comparable to guide dogs."}

These techniques are designed to protect privacy of data subjects while enabling useful analyses, but their reception by data users is under-explored. We developed documentation that presents the noise characteristics of two Wikipedia pageview datasets: one using rounding (heuristic privacy) and another using DP (formal privacy). After incorporating expert feedback (n=5), we used these documents to conduct a task-based contextual inquiry (n=15) exploring how data users--largely unfamiliar with these methods--perceive, interact with, and interpret privacy-preserving noise during data analysis.\n  Participants readily used simple uncertainty metrics from the documentation, but struggled when asked to compute confidence intervals across multiple noisy estimates. They were better able to devise simulation-based approaches for computing uncertainty with DP data compared to rounded data. Surprisingly, several participants incorrectly believed DP's stronger utility implied weaker privacy protections. Based on our findings, we offer design recommendations for documentation and tools to better support data users working with privacy-noised data."}

While higher-fidelity models enable more intelligent behavior, they incur increased computational cost. Since strong interactions are relatively infrequent in traffic, a practical strategy for balancing performance and computational overhead is to invoke an appropriate controller based on situational demands. To achieve this approach, we first conduct a comparative study to assess and hierarchize the interactive capabilities of different MPC formulations. Furthermore, we develop a neural network-based classifier to enable situation-aware switching among controllers with different levels of interactive capability. We demonstrate that this situation-aware switching can both substantially improve overall performance by activating the most advanced interactive MPC in rare but critical situations, and significantly reduce computational load by using a basic MPC in the majority of scenarios."}

However, current evaluations of system explainability often rely heavily on subjective user surveys, which may not adequately capture the effectiveness of explanations. This paper critiques the overreliance on user satisfaction metrics and explores whether these can differentiate between meaningful (actionable) and vacuous (placebic) explanations. In experiments involving optimal Social Security filing age selection tasks, participants used one of three protocols: no explanations, placebic explanations, and actionable explanations. Participants who received actionable explanations significantly outperformed the other groups in objective measures of their mental model, but users rated placebic and actionable explanations as equally satisfying. This suggests that subjective surveys alone fail to capture whether explanations truly support users in building useful domain understanding. We propose that future evaluations of agent explanation capabilities should integrate objective task performance metrics alongside subjective assessments to more accurately measure explanation quality.

To overcome this, methods excluding electronics from the operating environment while retaining advanced electronic control and actuation have been explored. These include the remote hydraulic drive of electronics-free mobile robots, which offer high reachability, and long wire-driven robot arms with motors consolidated at the base, which offer high environmental resistance. To combine the advantages of both, this study proposes a new system, \"Remote Wire Drive.\" As a proof-of-concept, we designed and developed the Remote Wire-Driven robot \"REWW-ARM\", which consists of the following components: 1) a novel power transmission mechanism, the \"Remote Wire Transmission Mechanism\" (RWTM), the key technology of the Remote Wire Drive; 2) an electronics-free distal mobile robot driven by it; and 3) a motor-unit that generates power and provides electronic closed-loop control based on state estimation via the RWTM.

Human relationships have historically relied on mutual forgetting, the natural tendency for both parties to forget details over time, as a foundation for psychological safety, forgiveness, and identity change. By contrast, AI systems can record, store, and recombine interaction histories at scale, often indefinitely. We introduce Memory Power Asymmetry (MPA): a structural power imbalance that arises when one relationship partner (typically an AI-enabled firm) possesses a substantially superior capacity to record, retain, retrieve, and integrate the shared history of the relationship, and can selectively deploy that history in ways the other partner (the human) cannot. Drawing on research in human memory, power-dependence theory, AI architecture, and consumer vulnerability, we develop a conceptual framework with four dimensions of MPA (persistence, accuracy, accessibility, integration) and four mechanisms by which memory asymmetry is translated into power (strategic memory deployment, narrative control, dependence asymmetry, vulnerability accumulation). We theorize downstream consequences at individual, relational/firm, and societal levels, formulate boundary-conditioned propositions, and articulate six design principles for restoring a healthier balance of memory in human-AI relationships (e.g., forgetting by design, contextual containment, symmetric access to records). Our analysis positions MPA as a distinct construct relative to information asymmetry, privacy, surveillance, and customer relationship management, and argues that protecting mutual forgetting, or at least mutual control over memory, should become a central design and policy goal in the AI age."}

We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining an online survey with semi-structured interviews. Our findings reveal that psychological resilience is a significant positive predictor of trust in AI, and that age significantly moderates the relationship between social anxiety and trust. The interviews further suggest that teenagers generally report relatively high levels of trust in AI, tend to overestimate their AI literacy, and are influenced by external factors such as social media."}

Traditional analytical approaches, such as clickstream logs or quiz scores, capture only coarse-grained learning outcomes and offer limited insight into learners' moment-to-moment cognitive states. In this study, we propose COIVis, an eye tracking-based visual analytics system that supports concept-level exploration of learning processes in MOOC videos. COIVis first extracts course concepts from multimodal video content and aligns them with the temporal structure and screen space of the lecture, defining Concepts of Interest (COIs), which anchor abstract concepts to specific spatiotemporal regions. Learners' gaze trajectories are transformed into COI sequences, and five interpretable learner-state features -- Attention, Cognitive Load, Interest, Preference, and Synchronicity -- are computed at the COI level based on eye tracking metrics. Building on these representations, COIVis provides a narrative, multi-view visualization enabling instructors to move from cohort-level overviews to individual learning paths, quickly locate problematic concepts, and compare diverse learning strategies. We evaluate COIVis through two case studies and in-depth user-feedback interviews. The results demonstrate that COIVis effectively provides instructors with valuable insights into the consistency and anomalies of learners' learning patterns, thereby supporting timely and personalized interventions for learners and optimizing instructional design."}

Under each theoretical perspective, we discuss how the integration of generative AI (GenAI) tools reshapes these dynamics by altering students' roles in cognitive, social, and creative processes. In the second part, we introduce a theoretical framework for AI agentic engagement, contextualizing agency within specific cognitive, relational, and ethical dynamics introduced by GenAI tools. This framework is linked to the concept of Mini-c creativity, emphasizing personal relevance and self-directed learning. Together, these perspectives support a shift from viewing creativity as product-oriented to understanding it as a process of agentive participation and meaning-making. We conclude with two directions for future research focused on the creative process and performance in AI-assisted learning."}

Current fault tolerant control (FTC) schemes for MWMRs target complete actuator failures like motor stall, ignoring partial faults e.g., in torque degradation. We propose an FTC strategy handling both fault types, where we adopt posterior probability to learn real-time fault parameters. We derive the FTC law by aggregating probability-weighed control laws corresponding to predefined faults. This ensures the robustness and safety of MWMR control despite varying levels of fault occurrence. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our FTC under diverse scenarios."}

Although GenAI offers great potential for education, its value often depends on students' ability to engage with it actively, responsibly, and critically - qualities central to student agency. Nevertheless, student agency has long been a complex and ambiguous concept in educational discourses, with few empirical studies clarifying its distinct nature and process in AI-assisted learning environments. To address this gap, the qualitative study presented in this article examines how higher education students exercise agency in AI-assisted learning and proposes a theoretical framework using a grounded theory approach. Guided by agentic engagement theory, this article analyzes the authentic experiences of 26 students using data from their GenAI conversation records and cognitive interviews that capture their thought processes and decision-making. The findings identify four key aspects of student agency: initiating and (re)directing, mindful adoption, external help-seeking, and reflective learning. Together, these aspects form an empirically developed framework that characterizes student agency in AI-assisted learning as a proactive, intentional, adaptive, reflective, and iterative process. Based on the empirical findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed for researchers, educators, and policymakers."}

From the classical PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), there is a series of deep reinforcement learning algorithms which are widely used in training locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots because of their stability and sample efficiency. However, among all these variants, experiments and simulations often converge prematurely, leading to suboptimal locomotion and reduced task performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation (ECIM), an entropy-based reinforcement learning algorithm in contrast with the PPO series, that can reduce premature convergence by combining intrinsic motivation with adaptive exploration.\n  For experiments, in order to parallel with other baselines, we chose to apply it in Isaac Gym across six terrain categories: upward slopes, downward slopes, uneven rough terrain, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and flat ground as widely used. For comparison, our experiments consistently achieve better performance: task rewards increase by 4--12%, peak body pitch oscillation is reduced by 23--29%, joint acceleration decreases by 20--32%, and joint torque consumption declines by 11--20%. Overall, our model ECIM, by combining entropy control and intrinsic motivation control, achieves better results in stability across different terrains for quadrupedal locomotion, and at the same time reduces energetic cost and makes it a practical choice for complex robotic control tasks."}

This research investigates user experience and preferences when interacting with a healthcare application utilizing virtual avatars displayed in different sizes. For our study, we had 23 participants interacting with five different avatars (a human-size avatar followed by four smaller avatars in a randomized order) varying in size, projected on a wall in front of them. The avatars were fully integrated with an artificial intelligence chatbot to make them conversational. Users were asked to rate the usability of the system after interacting with each avatar and complete a survey regarding trust and an additional questionnaire on social presence. The results of this study show that avatar size significantly influences the perceived attractiveness and perspicuity, with the medium-sized avatars receiving the highest ratings. Social presence correlated strongly with stimulation and attractiveness, suggesting that an avatar's visual appeal and interactivity influenced user engagement more than its physical size. Additionally, we observed a tendency for gender-specific differences on some of the UEQ+ scales, with male participants tending to prefer human-sized representations, while female participants slightly favored smaller avatars. These findings highlight the importance of avatar design and representation in optimizing user experience and trust in virtual healthcare environments."}

Vision-based approaches offer promising results for enabling prosthetic hands to interact more naturally with diverse objects in dynamic environments. Building on this foundation, the paper presents a vision-guided grasping algorithm for a prosthetic hand, integrating perception, planning, and control for dexterous manipulation. A camera mounted on the set up captures the scene, and a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)-based vision algorithm is employed to segment an object for grasping and define its bounding box. Grasp contact points are then computed by generating candidate trajectories using Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star algorithm, and selecting fingertip end poses based on the minimum Euclidean distance between these trajectories and the objects point cloud. Each finger grasp pose is determined independently, enabling adaptive, object-specific configurations. Damped Least Square (DLS) based Inverse kinematics solver is used to compute the corresponding joint angles, which are subsequently transmitted to the finger actuators for execution. This modular pipeline enables per-finger grasp planning and supports real-time adaptability in unstructured environments. The proposed method is validated in simulation, and experimental integration on a Linker Hand O7 platform."}

System latency and object misalignment can disrupt communication, reduce task efficiency, and negatively impact the overall user experience. While previous research has primarily focused on individual AR interactions, the impact of these inconsistencies on collaboration remains underexplored. This article investigates how user experience and task load are affected by object misalignment and time delay in a shared AR space. To examine these factors, we conducted an experiment with 32 participants, organized into 16 pairs, who collaboratively completed a spatial placement task. Within each condition, both participants alternated roles, taking turns as the leader-providing verbal placement instructions-and the builder-executing the placement. Six conditions were tested, manipulating object alignment (perfectly aligned vs. randomly misaligned) and time delay (0s, 0.1s, 0.4s). The misalignment was applied randomly to each virtual object with a shift of +-20 cm on every axis to create a clear distinction in spatial perception. User experience and task load were assessed to evaluate how these factors influence collaboration and interaction in AR environments. Results showed that spatial misalignment significantly increased perceived workload (NASA-TLX) and lowered user ratings in Pragmatic quality and Attractiveness (UEQ), while time delay had a more limited effect. These findings highlight the critical role of spatial accuracy in maintaining collaboration quality in AR."}

A hinge mechanism is integrated between the soft Fin-Ray structure and a rigid sensing module, allowing deformation and translation information to be transferred to a bottom crossbeam upon which are an array of marker-tipped pins based on the biomimetic structure of the TacTip vision-based tactile sensor. Deformation patterns captured by an internal camera are processed using a convolutional neural network to infer contact conditions without directly sensing the finger surface. The finger design was optimized by varying pin configurations and hinge orientations, achieving 0.1\\,mm depth and 2mm location-sensing accuracies. The perception demonstrated robust generalization to various indenter shapes and sizes, which was applied to a pick-and-place task under uncertain picking positions, where the tactile feedback significantly improved placement accuracy. Overall, this work provides a lightweight, flexible, and scalable tactile sensing solution suitable for soft robotic structures where the sensing needs situating away from the contact interface."}

The extent to which NPCs' coherence and consistency influence players' evaluation of them remains to be unveiled. To address this knowledge gap, two experiments were conducted in the context of a military shooter game. Players' evaluations of NPCs' perceived intelligence and believability were measured, as these two dimensions are fundamental to players' adoption of NPCs and subsequent commitment to them. The first experiment investigated the impact of disrupting players' initial expectations on their evaluations of NPCs. The second experiment focused on the influence of NPCs' coherence and consistency on both players' expectations and evaluation of NPCs, using a combination of questionnaires and behavioral and physiological measures. The results of our study show that disrupting players' initial expectations influences their assessment of NPCs, with coherent and consistent design reinforcing expectations and incoherent design challenging them."}

However, accurate comprehension is challenging due to a lack of large-scale datasets that capture natural embodied interactions in diverse HRI settings. Existing datasets suffer from perspective bias, single-view collection, inadequate coverage of nonverbal gestures, and a predominant focus on indoor environments. To address these issues, we present the Refer360 dataset, a large-scale dataset of embodied verbal and nonverbal interactions collected across diverse viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor settings. Additionally, we introduce MuRes, a multimodal guided residual module designed to improve embodied referring expression comprehension. MuRes acts as an information bottleneck, extracting salient modality-specific signals and reinforcing them into pre-trained representations to form complementary features for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four HRI datasets, including the Refer360 dataset, and demonstrate that current multimodal models fail to capture embodied interactions comprehensively; however, augmenting them with MuRes consistently improves performance. These findings establish Refer360 as a valuable benchmark and exhibit the potential of guided residual learning to advance embodied referring expression comprehension in robots operating within human environments."}

This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences."}

This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system that enables humanoid robots to execute robust continual ball-kicking with adaptability to different ball-goal configurations. The system extends a typical teacher-student training framework -- in which a \"teacher\" policy is trained with ground truth state information and the \"student\" learns to mimic it with noisy, imperfect sensing -- by including four training stages: (1) long-distance ball chasing (teacher); (2) directional kicking (teacher); (3) teacher policy distillation (student); and (4) student adaptation and refinement (student). Key design elements -- including tailored reward functions, realistic noise modeling, and online constrained RL for adaptation and refinement -- are critical for closing the sim-to-real gap and sustaining performance under perceptual uncertainty. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and on a real robot demonstrate strong kicking accuracy and goal-scoring success across diverse ball-goal configurations. Ablation studies further highlight the necessity of the constrained RL, noise modeling, and the adaptation stage.

They rely on a linear sequence of views, showing a curated set of relevant data selections and introduce user interfaces. Existing frameworks of tours, however, often do not allow for branching and refining hypotheses outside of a rigid sequence, which is important in knowledge-centric domains such as law. For example, lawyers performing analytical case analysis need to iteratively weigh up different legal norms and construct strings of arguments. To address this gap, we propose SemanticTours, a semantic, graph-based model of tours that shifts from a sequence-based towards a graph-based navigation. Our model constructs a domain-specific knowledge graph that connects data elements based on user-definable semantic relationships. These relationships enable non-linear graph navigation that defines tours. We apply SemanticTours to the domain of law and conceptualize a visual analytics design and interaction concept for analytical reasoning in legal case analysis. Our concept accounts for the inherent complexity of graph-based tours using aggregated graph nodes and supporting navigation with a semantic lens. During an evaluation with six domain experts from law, they suggest that graph-based tours better support their analytical reasoning than sequences. Our work opens research opportunities for such tours to support analytical reasoning in law and other knowledge-centric domains."}

However, as these systems evolved, the increase in the nonlinear dynamics and the complexity of interconnected variables have posed challenges that classical PID cannot effectively handle, often leading to instability, overshooting, or prolonged settling times. Researchers have proposed PIDNN models that combine the function approximation capabilities of neural networks with PID control to tackle these nonlinear challenges. However, these models require extensive, highly refined training data and have significant computational costs, making them less favorable for real-world applications. In this paper, We propose a novel EC-PIDUNN architecture, which integrates an untrained neural network with an improved PID controller, incorporating a stabilizing factor (\\(τ\\)) to generate the control signal. Like classical PID, our architecture uses the steady-state error \\(e_t\\) as input bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of the systems dynamics. By forming an input vector from \\(e_t\\) within the neural network, we increase the dimensionality of input allowing for richer data representation. Additionally, we introduce a vector of parameters \\( ρ_t \\) to shape the output trajectory and a \\textit{dynamic compute} function to adjust the PID coefficients from predefined values. We validate the effectiveness of EC-PIDUNN on multiple nonlinear robotics applications: (1) nonlinear unmanned ground vehicle systems that represent the Ackermann steering mechanism and kinematics control, (2) Pan-Tilt movement system. In both tests, it outperforms classical PID in convergence and stability achieving a nearly critically damped response."}

Many studies, however, do not sufficiently analyze the relative priorities among evaluation metrics, which compromises the fair assessment of methods with divergent objectives. Furthermore, trajectory-continuity metrics, specifically those requiring $C^2$ smoothness, are rarely incorporated. Current DRL approaches generally prioritize efficiency and proximal comfort, often neglecting trajectory optimization or addressing it only through simplistic, unvalidated smoothness reward. Nevertheless, effective trajectory optimization is essential to ensure naturalness, enhance comfort, and maximize the energy efficiency of any navigation system. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a unified framework that enables the fair and transparent assessment of navigation methods by examining the prioritization and joint evaluation of multiple optimization objectives. We further propose a novel reward-shaping strategy that explicitly emphasizes trajectory-curvature optimization. The resulting trajectory quality and adaptability are significantly enhanced across multi-scale scenarios. Through extensive 2D and 3D experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches."}

However, this one-size-fits-all approach fails to serve the broader ecosystem of web developers who need accessible solutions even when strict perceptual constraints cannot be satisfied. We introduce recursive optimization (Mode~1) that compounds small adjustments across iterations, achieving 93.68% success on all color pairs and 100% success on reasonable pairs (contrast ratio $ρ> 2.0$), representing a +27.23 percentage point improvement. A relaxed fallback mode (Mode~2) handles pathological edge cases, reaching 98.73% overall success. Evaluation on 10,000 realistic web color pairs demonstrates that context-aware constraint relaxation, combined with absolute hue preservation, enables practical accessibility compliance while maintaining brand color identity. The median perceptual change remains zero across all modes (most pairs already comply), while the 90th percentile reaches $ΔE_{2000} = 15.55$ in Mode~1 -- perceptually acceptable when hue invariance preserves the essential character of the original color.

Building on insights from this formative study, we developed GuideNav, a vision-only, teach-and-repeat navigation system. Inspired by how guide dogs are trained and assist their handlers, GuideNav autonomously repeats a path demonstrated by a sighted person using a robot. Specifically, the system constructs a topological representation of the taught route, integrates visual place recognition with temporal filtering, and employs a relative pose estimator to compute navigation actions - all without relying on costly, heavy, power-hungry sensors such as LiDAR. In field tests, GuideNav consistently achieved kilometer-scale route following across five outdoor environments, maintaining reliability despite noticeable scene variations between teach and repeat runs. A user study with 3 guide dog handlers and 1 guide dog trainer further confirmed the system's feasibility, marking (to our knowledge) the first demonstration of a quadruped mobile system retrieving a path in a manner comparable to guide dogs."}

Large Model (LM)-Driven Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm offers a promising solution, where LM serves as the backbone to extract latent features while MoE serves as the downstream head to dynamically select and aggregate specialized experts to adapt to different scenarios. However, routing and aggregating in MoE face intrinsic challenges, including imprecise expert selection due to flawed routing strategy and inefficient expert aggregation leading to suboptimal prediction. To address these issues, we propose a statistic-augmented, decoupled MoE }outing and Aggregating Mechanism (MoE-RAM) driven by LM. Specifically, on the one hand, MoE-RAM enhances expert routing by incorporating statistical retrieval mechanism to match LM-extracted latent features with cached prototypical features of the most relevant experts; on the other hand, MoE-RAM adaptively reweights experts' outputs in fusion by measuring statistical distances of experts' instant features against LM-extracted latent features. Benefiting from the synergy of the statistic-augmented MoE's routing and aggregating, MoE-RAM ultimately improves the prediction performance. We take the AD semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed MoE-RAM. Extensive experiments on AD datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoE-RAM compared to other MoE baselines and conventional single-model approaches."}

However, FL encounters critical challenges such as poor generalization and slow convergence due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data from diverse driving environments. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce Federated Deep Supervision and Regularization (FedDSR), a paradigm that incorporates multi-access intermediate layer supervision and regularization within federated AD system. Specifically, FedDSR comprises following integral strategies: (I) to select multiple intermediate layers based on predefined architecture-agnostic standards. (II) to compute mutual information (MI) and negative entropy (NE) on those selected layers to serve as intermediate loss and regularizer. These terms are integrated into the output-layer loss to form a unified optimization objective, enabling comprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. (III) to aggregate models from vehicles trained based on aforementioned rules of (I) and (II) to generate the global model on central server. By guiding and penalizing the learning of feature representations at intermediate stages, FedDSR enhances the model generalization and accelerates model convergence for federated AD. We then take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess FedDSR and apply FedDSR to multiple model architectures and FL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedDSR achieves up to 8.93% improvement in mIoU and 28.57% reduction in training rounds, compared to other FL baselines, making it highly suitable for practical deployment in federated AD ecosystems."}

Motivated by these limitations, this work presents a complete model-less control framework that bypasses kinematic modeling by using an empirically initialized Jacobian refined online through differential convex updates. Tip motion is generated via a real-time quadratic program that computes actuator increments while enforcing tendon slack avoidance and geometric limits. A backbone tension optimization term is introduced in this paper to regulate axial loading and suppress co-activation compression. The framework is validated across circular, pentagonal, and square trajectories, demonstrating smooth convergence, stable tension evolution, and sub-millimeter steady-state accuracy without any model calibration or parameter identification.

Current practice to solve the above problem via UV lighting or virtual transfer using learning-based models introduces hardware complexity or computing burdens. This paper introduces MagicSkin, a novel tactile skin with translucent, tinted markers balancing the modes of marker and markerless for VBTS. It enables simultaneous tangential displacement tracking, force prediction, and surface detail preservation. This skin is easy to plug into GelSight-family sensors without requiring additional hardware or software tools. We comprehensively evaluate MagicSkin in downstream tasks. The translucent markers impressively enhance rather than degrade sensing performance compared with traditional markerless and inked marker design: it achieves best performance in object classification (99.17\\%), texture classification (93.51\\%), tangential displacement tracking (97\\% point retention) and force prediction (66\\% improvement in total force error). These experimental results demonstrate that translucent skin eliminates the traditional performance trade-off in marker or markerless modes, paving the way for multimodal tactile sensing essential in tactile robotics.

Human subject experiments were conducted with three healthy individuals walking on two bilaterally compliant surfaces with ground stiffness values of 63 and 25 kN/m, representative of real-world soft environments.

While IDA-PBC has been extensively studied and applied to many systems, its practical implementation often remains confined to academic examples and, almost exclusively, to stabilization tasks. The main limitation of IDA-PBC stems from the complexity of analytically solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), referred to as the matching conditions, which enforce the pH structure of the closed-loop system. However, this is extremely challenging, especially for complex physical systems and tasks.\n  In this work, we propose a novel numerical approach for designing IDA-PBC controllers without solving the matching PDEs exactly. We cast the IDA-PBC problem as the learning of a neural ordinary differential equation. In particular, we rely on sparse dictionary learning to parametrize the desired closed-loop system as a sparse linear combination of nonlinear state-dependent functions. Optimization of the controller parameters is achieved by solving a multi-objective optimization problem whose cost function is composed of a generic task-dependent cost and a matching condition-dependent cost.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel, funnel-shaped, flexible robotic hand that preserves the softness and conical sheet designs in prior work while incorporating a controllable valve at the cone apex to enable precise, incremental dispensing of milligram-scale powder quantities. The hand is integrated with an external balance through a feedback control system based on a model of powder flow and online parameter identification.

Many such systems leverage soft components, which enable shape morphing but also introduce simulation and control challenges. Soft-body simulators remain limited in accuracy and computational tractability, while rigid-body simulators cannot capture soft-material dynamics. Here, we present a surrogate compliance modeling approach: rather than explicitly modeling soft-body physics, we introduce indirect variables representing soft-material deformation within a rigid-body simulator. We validate this approach using our amphibious robotic turtle, a quadruped with soft morphing limbs designed for multi-environment locomotion. By capturing deformation effects as changes in effective limb length and limb center of mass, and by applying reinforcement learning with extensive randomization of these indirect variables, we achieve reliable policy learning entirely in a rigid-body simulation. The resulting gaits transfer directly to hardware, demonstrating high-fidelity sim-to-real performance on hard, flat substrates and robust, though lower-fidelity, transfer on rheologically complex terrains. The learned closed-loop gaits exhibit unprecedented terrestrial maneuverability and achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in cost of transport compared to open-loop baselines.

Drawing on a five-day Wizard-of-Oz deployment of a mobile service robot in a university cafe, we analyze how people signal interaction readiness through nonverbal behaviors and how expert wizards use these cues to guide engagement. Motivated by these observations, we propose a two-stage pipeline in which lightweight perceptual detectors (gaze shifts and proxemics) are used to selectively trigger heavier video-based vision-language model (VLM) queries at socially meaningful moments. We evaluate this pipeline on replayed field interactions and compare two prompting strategies. Our findings suggest that selectively using VLMs as proxies for social reasoning enables socially responsive robot behavior, allowing robots to act appropriately by attending to the cues people naturally provide in real-world interactions."}

As the standards for immersion in XR continue to increase, the demands for SLAM benchmarking have become more stringent. Trajectory accuracy is the key metric, and marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to generate ground truth (GT) because of their drift-free and relatively accurate measurements. However, the precision of MoCap-based GT is limited by two factors: the spatiotemporal calibration with the device under test (DUT) and the inherent jitter in the MoCap measurements. These limitations hinder accurate SLAM benchmarking, particularly for key metrics like rotation error and inter-frame jitter, which are critical for immersive XR experiences. This paper presents a novel continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator to address these challenges. The proposed method integrates auxiliary inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to compensate for MoCap jitter. Additionally, a variable time synchronization method and a pose residual based on screw congruence constraints are proposed, enabling precise spatiotemporal calibration across multiple sensors and the DUT. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving the precision necessary for comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms in XR applications. Furthermore, we thoroughly validate the practicality of our method by benchmarking several leading XR devices and open-source SLAM algorithms.

In this work, we explicitly build a topological model of the configuration space of a tethered robot starting from a polygonal representation of the workspace where the robot moves. To do so, we first establish a link between the configuration space of the tethered robot and the universal covering space of the workspace, and then we exploit this link to develop an algorithm to compute a simplicial complex model of the configuration space. We show how this approach improves the performances of existing algorithms that build other types of representations of the configuration space. The proposed model can be computed in a fraction of the time required to build traditional homotopy-augmented graphs, and is continuous, allowing to solve the path planning task for tethered robots using a broad set of path planning algorithms."}

When multiple USVs operate in the same area, they may be required to dock to each other to perform a shared task. Existing approaches for the docking between autonomous USVs generally consider one USV as a stationary target, while the second one is tasked to reach the required docking pose. In this work, we propose a cooperative approach for USV-USV docking, where two USVs work together to dock at an agreed location. We use a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to solve the control problem, obtaining feasible trajectories that also guarantee constraint satisfaction. Owing to its model-based nature, this approach allows the rejection of disturbances, inclusive of exogenous inputs, by anticipating their effect on the USVs through the MPC prediction model. This is particularly effective in case of almost-stationary disturbances such as water currents. In simulations, we demonstrate how the proposed approach allows for a faster and more efficient docking with respect to existing approaches."}

We present a complete pipeline for constructing multi-rigid-body approximations of human hands that preserve realistic appearance while enabling real-time physics simulation. Starting from optical motion capture of a specific human hand, we construct a personalized MANO (Multi-Abstracted hand model with Neural Operations) model and convert it to a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) representation with anatomically consistent joint axes. The key technical challenge is projecting MANO's unconstrained SO(3) joint rotations onto the kinematically constrained joints of the rigid-body model. We derive closed-form solutions for single degree-of-freedom joints and introduce a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-corrected iterative method for two degree-of-freedom joints that properly handles the non-commutativity of rotations.

In such settings, limited perception, ambiguous terrain cues, and insufficient adaptation of gait timing can cause even a single misplaced or mistimed step to result in rapid loss of balance. We introduce a perceptive locomotion framework that merges terrain sensing, gait regulation, and whole-body control into a single reinforcement learning policy. A downward-facing depth camera mounted under the base observes the support region around the feet, and a compact U-Net reconstructs a dense egocentric height map from each frame in real time, operating at the same frequency as the control loop. The perceptual height map, together with proprioceptive observations, is processed by a unified policy that produces joint commands and a global stepping-phase signal, allowing gait timing and whole-body posture to be adapted jointly to the commanded motion and local terrain geometry. We further adopt a single-stage successive teacher-student training scheme for efficient policy learning and knowledge transfer. Experiments conducted on a 31-DoF, 1.65 m humanoid robot demonstrate robust locomotion in both simulation and real-world settings, including forward and backward stair ascent and descent, as well as crossing a 46 cm gap.

However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the \"Memory Trap\". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts."}

Identifying a near-complete set of relevant driving scenarios for such functionalities is challenging due to numerous degrees of freedom involved, each affecting the outcomes of the driving scenario differently. Moreover, with increasing technical complexity of new functionalities, the number of potentially relevant, particularly \"unknown unsafe\" scenarios is increasing. To enhance validation efficiency, it is essential to identify relevant scenarios in advance, starting with simpler domains like highways before moving to more complex environments such as urban traffic. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing lane change scenarios in highway traffic, which involve multiple degrees of freedom and present numerous safetyrelevant scenarios. We describe the process of data acquisition and processing of real-world data from public highway traffic, followed by the application of criticality measures on trajectory data to evaluate scenarios, as conducted within the AVEAS project (www.aveas.org). By linking the calculated measures to specific lane change driving scenarios and the conditions under which the data was collected, we facilitate the identification of safetyrelevant driving scenarios for various applications. Further, to tackle the extensive range of \"unknown unsafe\" scenarios, we propose a way to generate relevant scenarios by creating synthetic scenarios based on recorded ones. Consequently, we demonstrate and evaluate a processing chain that enables the identification of safety-relevant scenarios, the development of data-driven methods for extracting these scenarios, and the generation of synthetic critical scenarios via sampling on highways."}

However, despite its potential, virtual-physical fusion testing still faces challenges, such as limited element types, narrow testing scope, and fixed evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose the Virtual-Physical Testing Platform for Autonomous Vehicles (VP-AutoTest), which integrates over ten types of virtual and physical elements, including vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside infrastructure, to replicate the diversity of real-world traffic participants. The platform also supports both single-vehicle interaction and multi-vehicle cooperation testing, employing adversarial testing and parallel deduction to accelerate fault detection and explore algorithmic limits, while OBU and Redis communication enable seamless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation across all levels of cooperative automation. Furthermore, VP-AutoTest incorporates a multidimensional evaluation framework and AI-driven expert systems to conduct comprehensive performance assessment and defect diagnosis.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated promising capabilities for end-to-end robot control, existing approaches still exhibit limited generalization to tasks beyond their training distributions. In contrast, humans possess remarkable proficiency in acquiring novel skills by simply observing others performing them once. Inspired by this capability, we propose ViVLA, a generalist robotic manipulation policy that achieves efficient task learning from a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach jointly processes an expert demonstration video alongside the robot's visual observations to predict both the demonstrated action sequences and subsequent robot actions, effectively distilling fine-grained manipulation knowledge from expert behavior and transferring it seamlessly to the agent. To enhance the performance of ViVLA, we develop a scalable expert-agent pair data generation pipeline capable of synthesizing paired trajectories from easily accessible human videos, further augmented by curated pairs from publicly available datasets. This pipeline produces a total of 892,911 expert-agent samples for training ViVLA. Experimental results demonstrate that our ViVLA is able to acquire novel manipulation skills from only a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach achieves over 30% improvement on unseen LIBERO tasks and maintains above 35% gains with cross-embodiment videos. Real-world experiments demonstrate effective learning from human videos, yielding more than 38% improvement on unseen tasks."}

This produces a rich representation of reference motions from a minimal input set, enabling improved generalization across diverse motion styles and morphologies. We evaluate MDME on retargeting-free real-time motion imitation by conditioning robot control policies on the learned embeddings, demonstrating accurate reproduction of complex trajectories on both humanoid and quadruped platforms. Our comparative studies confirm that MDME outperforms prior approaches in reconstruction fidelity and generalizability to unseen motions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MDME can reproduce novel motion styles in real-time through zero-shot deployment, eliminating the need for task-specific tuning or online retargeting. These results position MDME as a generalizable and structure-aware foundation for scalable real-time robot imitation."}

DA-DP corrects zero-delay trajectories to their delay-compensated counterparts, and augments the policy with delay conditioning. We empirically validate DA-DP on a variety of tasks, robots, and delays and find its success rate more robust to delay than delay-unaware methods.

For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification.

At the planning level, we introduce the Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP), which, combined with an admittance model and an MPC formulation, generates dynamically feasible footstep plans.

Stiffness modulation regulates robot-object interaction, ensuring convergence to the desired relative configuration defined by the distance between the object and the robot's center of mass.
