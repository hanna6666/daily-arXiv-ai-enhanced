Robust planning ensures safety by considering worst-case\nrealizations, yet ignores uncertainty reduction and leads to overly\nconservative behavior.

Most approaches address this\nby adding a weighted exploration term to the cost, tuned to trade off the\nnominal objective and uncertainty reduction, but without formal consideration\nof when exploration is beneficial. Moreover, safety is enforced in some methods\nbut not in others.

Recent work\nhas relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state\nrepresentations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that\nreconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from\ncurrent observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are\ndifficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as\nclassification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate\ndirectly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that\nsafety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask:\nwhen are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we\nexamine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or\nmanufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic\nsafety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing\nfailure itself.

Contact angle measurements quantify liquid-surface\ninteractions, which depend strongly on liquid formulation. Herein, we present\nthe Robotic Autonomous Imaging Surface Evaluator (RAISE), a closed-loop,\nself-driving laboratory that is capable of linking liquid formulation\noptimization with surface wettability assessment. RAISE comprises a full\nexperimental orchestrator with the ability of mixing liquid ingredients to\ncreate varying formulation cocktails, transferring droplets of prepared\nformulations to a high-throughput stage, and using a pick-and-place camera tool\nfor automated droplet image capture. The system also includes an automated\nimage processing pipeline to measure contact angles. This closed loop\nexperiment orchestrator is integrated with a Bayesian Optimization (BO) client,\nwhich enables iterative exploration of new formulations based on previous\ncontact angle measurements to meet user-defined objectives. The system operates\nin a high-throughput manner and can achieve a measurement rate of approximately\n1 contact angle measurement per minute.

Yet, most VLA models are still trained\nwith supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under\ndistribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL)\noffers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through\ninteraction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified\nplatform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and\nalgorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and\nefficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a\nhighly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of\nintegrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In\nparticular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel\nhybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup\nin training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse\nVLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g.,\nPPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a\nunified model achieves 98.11\\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\\% across 25\nManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best\npractices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns\nin this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a\nreal-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger\ngeneralization than those trained with SFT.

Our approach starts with a comprehensive\ndescription of the driving scenario to prompt large language models to generate\nand rank feasible driving actions. These actions are translated into temporal\nlogic formulas that incorporate formalized traffic rules, and are subsequently\nintegrated into reachability analysis to eliminate unsafe actions. We validate\nour approach in both open-loop and closed-loop driving environments using\noff-the-shelf and finetuned large language models, showing that it can provide\nprovably safe and, where possible, legally compliant driving actions, even\nunder high-density traffic conditions.

However, environmental perturbations or\nexecution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery\nbehaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take\nadvantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that\nautonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich\ntrajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to\nestimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an\nout-of-distribution detection problem.

Traditional\ntesting methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which\nmakes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the\ninability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may\nencounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic\ntesting framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica\nof the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital\ntwin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,\nour approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving\nscenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental\nfeatures, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.\nThe digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes\ncan be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,\nwe define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and\nvehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving\nsimulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and\neffectiveness.

To address these challenges, we\npresent TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances\nembodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism\nand a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a\nChain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative\nposition and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action\nprediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update\nstrategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal\nconsistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive\nexperiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on\npublic benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings.

To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1)\nTerrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages\npre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with\nminimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which\nreconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3)\nRealistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray\ncasting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations,\nachieving over 30\\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination\nenables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources,\nwhile preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization.
