While prior studies have primarily focused on conveying\nvirtual movement, the modulation of perceived heaviness has received little\nattention. Presenting a sense of heaviness is essential for enriching haptic\ninteractions with virtual objects.

To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure.

Imitating human motions with\nreinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but\nexisting methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects\ndeviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when\nthe robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots\nto respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and\nposture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an\naugmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a\nreinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant\nresponses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns\nto absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion\nclip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments,\ndemonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment."}

Recent embodied systems often adopt a\ndual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System\n1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the\nembodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and\ndecision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation\nof the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution\nsuccess, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete\ndimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of\ncognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark\nthat systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as\nembodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation\npipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,\nperception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure\nanalysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure\nrealism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,\nand multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For\nplanning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,\nMLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether\npredicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14\nMLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction\ncomprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained\naffordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a\ncomprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the\ndevelopment of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in\nhttps://robo-bench.github.io."}
